Apple,"Using after 3 months honest review. This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.",2023-12-30,positive,5,en,using months honest review first iphone always feels good hold masterpiece looks premium branding everything makes feel premium however despite looks finish transition android apple smooth may constantly lack certain features make life easy using vivo lite still phone putting feature missed forwarding anything whatsapp forwarding anything whatsapp iphone takes bit step compared offered android makes entire process slow android user app switcher apple could easily made app switcher easy light swipe instead made long pressed swipe man dont features swipe make easy launch andorid dialer always missed every android basic feature search contact directly phone dialer dialer used dialing number suggest similar contact contacts last dial really bad dial number directly use dialer dial someone recent call log shift dial someone contact shift man done one button dialer android user miss badly sending multiple files whatsapp wants add file directly whatsapp twice android one simple start selecting whatspp select many files wants send single click sending multiple files go gallery folder select files first share whatsapp swipe based shifting chats status calls android whatsapp switch calls chats status swiping press button contact viewing contact list sorting method still mind man make easy example one contacts first name middle name last name one thing start alphabet shown top list apple pls adopt one method least allow us customise many apps android much refined version apple use samsung pay samsung pay one best app making upi card payment swipe home screen samsung phones series app open payment miss badly lack dual messenger facility cant use two different whatsapp numbers phone supported android right nowthese issues face right apart phone good sound loud clear feels premium hand touch good face id works like charm gesture control customisation really good customise lot things,2,2

Apple,"Go for it... you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark â?all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail.",2021-09-25,positive,5,en,go really dont need upgrade bought new iphone last year anyone iphone older find enough new parts features consider new modelsscreenthe screen notably better last years first iphone apples promotion display high refreshrate screen technology introduced ipad pro screen adjust content page help save battery life make things feel smoother youre reading website example might refresh less frequently save battery life youre gaming scrolling long webpage itll refresh really fast make everything much smootherbatterybattery life topnotch lasts longer iphone market unless youre playing games hours hoursthats thanks combination newer processor new screen bigger battery streamed nine hours movies example brightness still half battery leftcamerathe regular wideangle zoom ultrawideangle lenses back allow light means theyre better taking pictures darkthe hdr feature also better situations subject might lot light behind normally make people picture look dark aall iphone phones keep color detail even sun right behind someoneyou get really close object like blueberry flower capture lot detail,2,2

Apple,"The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!. We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neoâs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12âs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldnât recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I donât think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionicâs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.Iâm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. Iâd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around â?be it via USB-C or MagSafe â?as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",2022-07-27,positive,5,en,iphone new benchmark flagship phones pretty confident say iphone best iphone people may look like apple changed position one phones back cameras since last years model trust us say substantial upgrades new display larger battery better camera hardware software iphone new benchmark flagship phonesonce apples made iphone far powerful android competitors thanks gready bionic chip raw performance doesnt interest photographers play new photographic style filters camera app videographers excited new cinematic mode focusracking abilitythe regular iphone flaws charging still relatively slow compared android phones dont like iphone pro models get hz display telephoto zoom based indepth iphone review new iphone best phone moneythe overall display quality continues stellar watching trailer matrix resurrections mesmerized neon code encircling neo walked street another scene could make individual hairs neoas beard stared sundisplay smaller notch makes display bit immersive slightly different button placement pink blue standout colors new green color launched march camera bright colorful images beat samsung ultrawide camera delivers scenes improved night mode photographic styles give creative controlvideo cinematic mode automatically changes focus subjects adding bokeh superior dolby vision hdr video qualityperformance bionica bionic fastest chip machine learning performance notably betterbattery life hours minutes battery life hours better iphone softwareshareplay lets watch videos listen music friends focus cuts distractionsverdict iphone improves already best iphone people introducing bunch welcome enhancements especially like longer battery life iphone endurance underwhelming even g phone wouldnat recommend iphone owners upgrade new iphone iphone worth iphone older devicei donat think many people care smaller notch truly stands iphone camera lowlight performance even better computational photography features like cinematic mode photographic styles flex bionicas muscles ways go way beyond benchmarksiam also glad apple doubled starting storage gb move overdue puts new iphone par android flagships iad like see apple offering faster charging next time around abe via usbc magsafe aas well hz displaythe bottom line iphone fantastic phone raises bar think camera phone,2,2

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair .

Apple,"1st purchase was great! This one was not!. I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.",2024-09-19,negative,1,en,st purchase great one iphone daysit worst battery life iphone ive ever owned owned iphones since first version released years agothis second iphone ive bought renewed store first one bought december th could happier phoneit arrived brand new condition performed flawlesslyon recommendation friend checked battery health charging months thrilledi absolutely loved phonei never single problem itunfortunately july year dropped beyond repairi immediately went back amazon renewed store purchased another iphone experience first one fantasticit arrived new looking condition exactly like one bought december scratched anything really noticeable seemed worn little bit fully understood renewed phone cosmetic issues important including color iphone case cannot tell color anywayunfortunately look battery health charging first got phone days ago look two weeks ago said thought ok renewed phone going battery lifei live thatwell looked today battery health chargingso phone dying quicklyafter fully charged dies within hoursi completely set optimized battery lifei lost emails messages middle composing phone diesive middle important phone calls phone dies simply fully charged hours thought would fine hours comei total shoulder replacement surgery week ago phone doctors office yesterday first postop appointment phone died middle iti thought hours left phone would diethen plug wait come back alive could call doctor back hopefully wait half hour losing place lineon top also issues touchscreen glitchy sometimes tap things several times get workas said iphone owneruser since first version came years agoive always loved iphones continue iphone user rest lifethis way reflection apple iphones whatsoeverthey amazing fantastic piece technologyi think got bad one first time lifeluckily checked november th return phone returning itthe problem meantimeam expected buy new one get shipped transfer information phone new one return onethat extremely hard financiallyi actually still paying phone amazon prime american express cardor return phone wait refund issued buy another phone wait sent mei would phone least week interim know days thats practical impossibilityi also several medical issueslike said total shoulder replacement surgery last monday september th several upcoming follow appointments physical therapy appointmentsi also several nonrelated medical issues definitely require phonei dont know,0,0

Apple,"The BEST iPhone EVERRRRRRR! : iPhone 15 review after 2 weeks of continuous use. The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps.

Apple,"The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!. We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neoâs beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1.

Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12âs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldnât recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I donât think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionicâs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.Iâm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. Iâd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around â?be it via USB-C or MagSafe â?as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do.",2022-07-27,positive,5,en,iphone new benchmark flagship phones pretty confident say iphone best iphone people may look like apple changed position one phones back cameras since last years model trust us say substantial upgrades new display larger battery better camera hardware software iphone new benchmark flagship phonesonce apples made iphone far powerful android competitors thanks gready bionic chip raw performance doesnt interest photographers play new photographic style filters camera app videographers excited new cinematic mode focusracking abilitythe regular iphone flaws charging still relatively slow compared android phones dont like iphone pro models get hz display telephoto zoom based indepth iphone review new iphone best phone moneythe overall display quality continues stellar watching trailer matrix resurrections mesmerized neon code encircling neo walked street another scene could make individual hairs neoas beard stared sundisplay smaller notch makes display bit immersive slightly different button placement pink blue standout colors new green color launched march camera bright colorful images beat samsung ultrawide camera delivers scenes improved night mode photographic styles give creative controlvideo cinematic mode automatically changes focus subjects adding bokeh superior dolby vision hdr video qualityperformance bionica bionic fastest chip machine learning performance notably betterbattery life hours minutes battery life hours better iphone softwareshareplay lets watch videos listen music friends focus cuts distractionsverdict iphone improves already best iphone people introducing bunch welcome enhancements especially like longer battery life iphone endurance underwhelming even g phone wouldnat recommend iphone owners upgrade new iphone iphone worth iphone older devicei donat think many people care smaller notch truly stands iphone camera lowlight performance even better computational photography features like cinematic mode photographic styles flex bionicas muscles ways go way beyond benchmarksiam also glad apple doubled starting storage gb move overdue puts new iphone par android flagships iad like see apple offering faster charging next time around abe via usbc magsafe aas well hz displaythe bottom line iphone fantastic phone raises bar think camera phone,2,2

Apple,"Apple iPhone 13 (256GB) - Pink. The Apple iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink offers a combination of elegant design, solid performance, and advanced features. Hereâs a detailed review:### Design and BuildThe iPhone 13 in Pink sports a sleek and refined design with flat edges, a ceramic shield front cover, and aerospace-grade aluminum edges. The Pink color option is soft and subtle, making it an attractive choice for those who prefer a pastel look. The device feels premium in hand, and its compact size makes it comfortable to use one-handed.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is vibrant and sharp, providing excellent color accuracy and contrast. Whether youâre streaming videos, browsing photos, or playing games, the display offers a rich visual experience. The smaller notch compared to previous models also allows for slightly more screen real estate.### PerformancePowered by the A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 13 delivers fast and efficient performance. Whether youâre multitasking, gaming, or using resource-intensive apps, the device handles everything smoothly. The 256GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it a good option for users who require more storage.### CameraThe dual-camera system features a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. The cameras perform exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, producing detailed and vibrant photos. The improved low-light performance and Night mode make it possible to capture clear images even in dim settings. The new Photographic Styles feature allows for customization of the tone and color of your photos without compromising on the overall quality.### Battery LifeThe iPhone 13 offers improved battery life compared to its predecessor. With moderate use, the device can easily last a full day on a single charge. The introduction of smart data modes, which switch between 5G and LTE depending on your usage, also helps in conserving battery.### SoftwareRunning on iOS 15, the iPhone 13 brings a range of new features and enhancements, such as Focus mode, redesigned notifications, and improved FaceTime capabilities. The user interface is smooth and intuitive, making it easy to navigate through apps and settings.### Additional Features- **5G Connectivity:** Offers faster download and upload speeds, improving the overall browsing and streaming experience.- **MagSafe Compatibility:** The device supports MagSafe accessories, allowing for easy attachment of chargers, wallets, and other accessories.- **Water and Dust Resistance:** The iPhone 13 is rated IP68, meaning it can withstand being submerged in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.### ConclusionThe iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink is a solid choice for those looking for a stylish and powerful smartphone.

Apple,"Iphone 13. After purchasing the iPhone 13, Iâm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Hereâs a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. Itâs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features.

samsung,"Phone keeps on Going. I purchased this phone for Net 10 over a year ago for my 12 year old. About 4 months ago, my son was playing around and his phone ""flew"" out the window of a moving bus. We went back and recovered the phone from the side of the road. The battery was about 20 feet away and the cover was in the opposite direction. To my amazement, we put the phone back together and the phone worked immediately, only had some minor cosmetic damage. Last night we had a terrible storm and the phone was plugged in and charging. A transformer blew outside and a power surge rushed through my house. The phone started smoking and the back cover melted. The inside is scortched and smells like an electrical fire.

samsung,"If you just need a phone that works as promised, skip this. I returned this phone after 3 days. I was an early Android user (MyTouch) and switched to iPhone in 2012. iPhones have their own issues, especially with batteries, so I thought it would be fun to try out something totally new. I've been hearing so much praise for the Samsungs so I got a gold S7. I will say that I loved the feel and look of it. That's all I loved though. Here are the worst things about it: 1. The battery drained shockingly quick. At the end of the day I was at 15%. For a brand new phone that's really bad. 2. The phone comes packed with bloatware that cannot be removed. 3. The Android operating system is truly awful. There were so many weird quirks, bugs, and missing features. For example, there wasn't a restricted access mode so you can have your kids watch a video and not mess with the screen...but there's an app for one. Or the sound produced by the Samsung headphones is so bad I actually thought they were broken. They're not...but there's an app to ""fix"" that. Are you freaking kidding me?! Even seemingly little things caused a ton of inconvenience. My phone connected to my car's stereo via Bluetooth, but I was not able to use the car's controls. I had to actually pick up and unlock the phone to change a song. To Spotify it's probably just a little bug that they'll get around to fixing whenever, but to me it's a big deal. And I realized that if I kept this phone I'd better settle in for many of these situations, because the truth is developers don't care about Android and its apps will always be given lowest priority. And I'm not about to accept that when I paid for a ""top of the line"" phone. Is this what passes for normal to longtime Android users? Was that my fatal mistake, switching to this OS with too-high expectations, like having full Bluetooth functionality, or sending text messages without an app crash? 4. The phone was always warm/hot. Even when I wasn't using it. I'd pick it up and it'd be suspiciously warm. Made me very nervous given Samsung's recent fire issues. So back this terrible phone went. It's too bad, I think the design is beautiful and I wanted it to work because Apple isn't super great either.

samsung,"Beautiful phone with great functionalities.. Beautiful phone with great functionalities and it is an incredible advancement from my old Samsung Galaxy Avant which is a great working phone, but it's been getting buggy in the last six months. I got mine through Fed Ex this morning so I will update my post in a few weeks but so far, I could not be happier. I got my phone from a different vendor out of Australia but shipped directly to me from Hong Kong, but I suspect it will be the same phone no matter when you buy it. My service provider is Metro PCS, which I am very happy to find out that I can keep and I took my phone to my local Metro PCS store and they got my phone working in less than 15 minutes. They explained the functions of the SIM slot #1 and #2 and how to insert a micro card. I had Metro add the International Calling plan to my phone for texting and calls from the U.S. I will use the SIM slot #2 for when I travel to France. Having a backup will help out. The style and glass front of the phone is very nice and it does not leave fingerprints. My old phone is the Samsung Galaxy Avant and I find that having my new phone is not difficult to re-learn. Some of the basic functions are the same. After getting home, I entered my passcode for my home wi-fi and the phone took it immediately and updated itself promptly. I also got the bluetooth function connected to my Fiat Sport 500c in less than five minutes. The batter powers up in no time to full and this morning, out of the box, my phone was at about 50% power. It took about 30 minutes to get it to 100%. So far, the battery tends to drain slowly. I read from another post of this phone that it did not have wi-fi. Not sure what happened, but this phone certainly does have it. The cord has a different end that plugs into the phone, so my old USB cords won't work however, the S8 box includes some attachments. One attachment is a small add-on that will fit on the small end of the USB cord so you can keep your old cords. The box also adds a connector so you can transfer files from one phone to another, or a computer to your phone and finally a 100-240 charging plug is included in the box, but it is not for European sockets nor American sockets. The two male connectors are slightly slanted so I suspect this is for Asia. I am not going to clone my Galaxy Avant software to my new phone because I want to begin fresh again. I will pick and choose each app but my Avant still works at home with my wi-fi and Magic Jack phone. There is only one slight disappointment; I expected the phone to be more of a gold tone color. The back of the phone is not really gold, but a slight gold tone with an odd color that seems to change color depending on the light available. Also, the front glass is gold tone once you pull up the apps, SMS, dialer, etc. I find this phone to be very advanced and a very good buy for the money I paid. It's basically a mini-computer and I use it for everything from driving, texting, phone, pictures, banking, buying, etc. This phone is definitely an incredible upgrade from my Avant and I am very pleased.

samsung,"Not as good as Galaxy S7. Very significant difference in S10e vs S7. â¢Charger is different. The universal chargers we've all gotten used to with Android is no longer. Phone has a wider plug on the bottom so you definitely need to use the wall charger in the box but your car charger will be effectively useless. â¢Camera is grainy. There are so many options with the camera that it renders the phone useless. The settings are all very confusing and convoluted. If you're anything like me and enjoy just a simple, good quality image, the S7 is vastly superior. I can't print pictures anymore they just look horrible. the screenshot function is different. Instead of holding down the top right button and bottom button, you now need both hands to hold a button on the right and the volume down on the left. Ignorant change. â¢Ring tones are all Asian. Not a single stereotypical sounding ring. Same with alarm sounds, they all sound spacey or futuristic. None sound like an actual alarm clock. â?There is no more quick app for Applications. You have to thumb upwards on the main screen. You also can't easily change media volume vs ringer volume. That requires a bit of maneuvering unlike the S7 where all the sounds could be changed in one location. â¢Finally if you purchase an unlocked phone and stay on a Verizon plan, you don't immediately have easy access to voicemails. You have to sign your life away to a 3rd party to see your voicemails in chronological order. Otherwise you have to * or # a number, enter your password, and listen to all the voicemails starting with the earliest saved messages. It'll be up to you to decide if any of these inconveniences are dealbreakers.

samsung,"Love it for pen. Hate it for pen software and lack of tools... You want a phone with Stylus? This is the one to get because literally nothing else compares. That being said the Note line is turning into something of a yawner. It used to be the phone packed to the gills with sensors and tools... Take my Note3 for example... It also included an IR blaster (full programmable universal remote - control hotel TV's, trigger DSLR and other uses) it also had ambient temperature and barometric sensors (little weather station in your pocket.) The Note8 lacks both. Even the pen, while great, the app to use it the most (their own Notes app) is terrible compared to the one from the Note3. Gear VR: they had to come out with two headsets in 2017 because the s8 headset which I have doesn't fit the Note8.. This shows a clear lack of planning on Samsung's part, and troubling as this is beginning to feel like a trend. To be clear I like the phone and don't regret buying it...

samsung,"screen mirroring has been difficult. I decided to stop trying to get my Galaxy J7 Sky Pro to screen mirror because it doesn't have the ability natively. Apps worked once in a blue moon. Decided to get a phone that is supposed to have screen mirroring ability built in. The A20 is supposed to mirror my device but it's been a struggle getting it to work. Been to the Samsung forum and I guess I should have gone there first. Way too many posts from people that can't get this to work with their Samsung phones. All of them, not just the A20. There was a post from someone that had in International phone and the forum wouldn't help him because of that. The forum is for US phones. Found 2 different methods that work! It'll do till I get the Actiontec Screenbeam (and I hope it works) I ordered. Returning an EZCast hdmi adapter that didn't work. I have my Roku TV connected to an adapter with my Huion drawing tablet/monitor. They are mirrored when I have my computer selected on Roku. Method 1) I tried about 20 apps. I finally found one and only one app that works with my A20 (Screen Cast Mirroring by MOBZAPP). I even paid the $4.99 to get rid of the ads I like it so much. First app I've ever bought! Unless you've rooted your phone, the sound will still be from the phone. MOBZAPP has an app for the sound issue if your phone is rooted. I won't be doing that. Medhod 2) Go to google play and get the teamviewer app for Samsung (free for home use). It'll tell you to go to their web-site and you'll download an app for your pc and your phone will give you a ""partner id"" number. You input that in the program on your pc. And there it is, your phone on your pc. The sound is still coming from your phone. This would have worked on my J7 phone as well. It's less than perfect, but I can watch shows from my Mobdro app. It's a great app. It looks much better with the A20 having 720p resolution. And the feed is more stable with the better processors and more ram. One really nice surprise was the 128 gb micro sd card instead of the 32 gb card I was expecting. And a game I played on the J7 was really slow and it is faster on the A20. Like everyone else I love the screen. And the dark mode is great. As I use it I find more things to appreciate about the phone. I was VERY upset after I first tried to mirror the phone and couldn't get it to work for 2 days. And it still takes an app or hardware.

I have a 16GB card installed also. BUT...many apps about 80% will NOT allow you to move them from internal to external memory. So i was able to add about 3 apps and i am out of internal memory.

samsung,"Best Samsung Phone Ever!. In order for me to do a complete review for this device I'd need to write a Trilogy! I will try to make this as brief as possible. First off, the display on this phone is breathtaking. Coming from a Galaxy S6 I never knew that a AMOLED display could outperform another AMOLED display. I also love that it's waterproof! I hesitated to use it in the rain since I've never had a waterproof phone before but now I don't even think about it. Next the camera was better than I imagined it would be. Zooming is incredible and I'm able to take high-speed photos without any distortion. 4K video is performs pretty much the same as my S6. It is nice that I can also plug my phone into a HDMI splitter and connect it to my TV. I haven't tried the DeX station yet but my S6 didn't support MHL so that's a nice addition. Call quality is pretty good. I love that this phone is Unlocked so it is not adhered to any one can. I have it on AT&T and believe it or not I do miss some of the functions from my S6. I would like to find out how to get their WiFi calling, Advanced Messaging, and VoLTE capability. Next, I did not think I would use the S Pen nearly as much as I do but there is so much you can do with it. Thank God I have legible handwriting or that fearure would be useless. However, my favorite thing to do is going into the PENUP app and doing some coloring. Suffice it to say the S Pen is amazing and you'll use it more than you think. Next thing that is amazing to use is the new Gear VR. It comes with a micro USB adapter so it's backwards compatible with my S6, if I really cared to use it. The last thing I'll talk about is how powerful this phone is. I thought having an Octa-Core processor and 3GB RAM in the S6 was amazing. With the Snapdragon 835 and 6GB this phone has no LAG! I'm not exaggerating either. So, if you want my opinion and you were really considering to get this phone GET IT!",2017-11-09,positive,5,en,best samsung phone ever order complete review device id need write trilogy try make brief possible first display phone breathtaking coming galaxy never knew amoled display could outperform another amoled display also love waterproof hesitated use rain since ive never waterproof phone dont even think next camera better imagined would zooming incredible im able take highspeed photos without distortion k video performs pretty much nice also plug phone hdmi splitter connect tv havent tried dex station yet didnt support mhl thats nice addition call quality pretty good love phone unlocked adhered one att believe miss functions would like find get wifi calling advanced messaging volte capability next think would use pen nearly much much thank god legible handwriting fearure would useless however favorite thing going penup app coloring suffice say pen amazing youll use think next thing amazing use new gear vr comes micro usb adapter backwards compatible really cared use last thing ill talk powerful phone thought octacore processor gb ram amazing snapdragon gb phone lag im exaggerating either want opinion really considering get phone get,2,2
samsung,"Universal File Storage 3 is FAST. The Note 10+ may be the best phone ever... and not for the reasons you think! The Note 10+ has UFS 3.0, a first for Samsung and this thing flies! Universal Flash Storage 3 is not only over 2 times the old standard (2.1=1200 MB/s vs 3.0=2900 MB/s) but it also has lower power consumption. So far app and game launches are blazing fast. Time will tell, but with these whopping storage options, 12GB of Ram and 4300mAh battery, this beast is going to keep going and going! And when you need to charge it, Fast Charge has you covered. HOWEVER, for even faster charging, get a super amped USB-C charger (87w/90w). Iâve got one for my laptop (ordered from Zon) and it feeds the Sammy 10+ faster than the included adapter. When my Note was at 75%, the Samsung stock adapter showed 41 minutes to full charge. When I hooked it up to my USB-C brick charger, it stated 36 minutes but was done in 33! (I was not using the phone at the time). So if you want faster you can get it. Wireless charging worked great, with and without a few cases I tested, along with my magnetic chip insert, it didnât get in the way. In the box: -Phone -USB-C Charger with 3ft cable -USB-C AKG Headset (sounds fab, rubber like cords near ear and mic, soft braided cord going into the phone) -Extra Ear nubs (S/M/L) -Some documents which in the picture you will find a key one... The Note 10+ Unlocked comes with a screen protector! What a great surprise. Itâs always a challenge getting good EDGE coverage on a 3rd party glass or skin. This one is tight. I wouldnât have known right away had it not included the paper telling me so. Iâve included some pics (with some dust to show contrast hah). Over the top couldnât be happier with the phone so far. You have camera and fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen as advertised, but also a hidden top speaker. With the bottom and top speakers going the phone presents quite well. Be sure to turn on Dolby Atmos in the toggle section right away to get the hidden speaker to perform even better.

samsung,"Don't let this one slip!. Nice phone at a great price... so I thought. The screen looked wonderful, the camera was fast and the pics looked great. It was actually loud enough to hear it ring, and I thought I found the perfect phone. Then today came. I accidently dropped it out of my car from the seat to the ground, and now, no phone. It still rings, it still signals texts coming in, but the screen will NOT come on. The phone was in the ""protective"" case that came with it. The Super Shieldz screen protector is still in tact, but I looks like there are actual cracks in the screen underneath. I've dropped phones from my shoulder (much higher than my seat) and only cracked a screen protector, and the phones never stopped working. If this phone is so sensitive to a 2 foot drop, why would you even think of shipping it with such an ineffective case and not warning about it's extreme sensitivity to heights. If anyone buys this touchy little phone throw out the worthless case and get an otter box or some other large clunky case to protect it and only use it over carpeting... BTW, my Asus Zenphone has taken MANY falls in a similar case and it hasn't missed a beat. I love the SuperShieldz, and appreciate the screen protection they provide, but what good is a phone that comes with a case that can't even take a fall from roughly knee level while in it's protective case that came in the same box. No screen means no phone.... Skip this one and get a Zenphone. ""upgrading"" is not worth it. My Zen is back on with a bigger SD card, so let's carry on and pass on the sensitive little A50, maybe that's why it was so cheap... No wait my Zen is a hundred bucks less.... with a better battery and it can take a drop. if you do drop it, and it is broke, don't bother chatting with them. 30 Minutes with Tech support, who forwarded me to someone that could help me, who 20 minutes later told me my only option that he could offer was to chat with tech support. Tech supports solution? Take it to a store and they can fix it..... They couldn't even give an estimate on the cost of a replacement screen! You should probably pass on this one!

Other cases have corner gaps inside the case so the phone doesn't get all the energy transferred to the corner if it falls. Not so for the Samsung case. If you buy the phone, get a better case than what Samsung sells, and keep in mind you might want an Otterbox case, which is big. And this is a big phone.

samsung,"Frustratingly Flawed. Now that I've had this for over six months, I feel like I can write an informed review. I wanted to replace my old LG8300 phone, which I'd had for around 8 years - the <send> button finally wore out. My requirements were few: another reasonably sturdy flip phone, but this time with a better camera and a universal charging jack. The convoy met those requirements. But in so many ways this new phone is inferior to my old one. The first, and most extremely frustrating, strike against it is what I suppose one can call it's Order of Operations. When something new shows up on the screen, that thing must be addressed immediately, before you can continue what you were doing. This becomes irksome in many situations, though none so much as when you're in the middle of some lengthy phone tree with your car insurance company or doctor or tech support somewhere, and a text or call shows up. Often, I've accidentally answered a call and lost my connection after 7 minutes of phone trees and hold music by not noticing fast enough that there was something new on the screen while I typed. Next, this phone has no capacity to learn new words. Old phone would have a memory for words I used when texting and would auto-suggest memorized words. Convoy doesn't, so frequently used words or names must continually be spelled out rather than using the word function, an extra toggle/button push that makes texting on a numeric keypad far less functional. The side buttons are far too sensitive for a ""rugged"" phone - I accidentally push the volume and PTT buttons all the time. Another screen one must close because you accidentally opened the ""Push To Talk is not set up on this phone"" warning screen while typing a text. As other reviewers have mentioned, the front screen doesn't always turn off when it should, draining the battery. It is easily corrected by opening and closing it again, but I won't notice it in the first place if it's in my purse. The ""lock"" on the back holding in the battery case is a joke. I can turn it with my thumb and precious little effort, it comes undone all the time. It's not designed to be tightened - it doesn't come out - simply a locked or unlocked position. The good: sound quality is pretty decent. I find my mother and myself squawking ""What?"" far less often when we talk. It also seems to be fairly rugged, it's fallen down a few stairs already and been dropped a handful of times. The camera is much better than my last (though difficult to get to pictures) and I appreciate being able to use any mini-usb charger. Which is especially useful now that it's draining its own battery more and more often. I'm not ready to get rid of it yet, it's not so bad as to replace it early. But I'll have to venture into the world of smart phones after all, if manufacturers don't do better than this next time I buy.",2015-07-17,negative,2,en,frustratingly flawed ive six months feel like write informed review wanted replace old lg phone id around years button finally wore requirements another reasonably sturdy flip phone time better camera universal charging jack convoy met requirements many ways new phone inferior old one first extremely frustrating strike suppose one call order operations something new shows screen thing must addressed immediately continue becomes irksome many situations though none much youre middle lengthy phone tree car insurance company doctor tech support somewhere text call shows often ive accidentally answered call lost connection minutes phone trees hold music noticing fast enough something new screen typed next phone capacity learn new words old phone would memory words used texting would autosuggest memorized words convoy doesnt frequently used words names must continually spelled rather using word function extra togglebutton push makes texting numeric keypad far less functional side buttons far sensitive rugged phone accidentally push volume ptt buttons time another screen one must close accidentally opened push talk set phone warning screen typing text reviewers mentioned front screen doesnt always turn draining battery easily corrected opening closing wont notice first place purse lock back holding battery case joke turn thumb precious little effort comes undone time designed tightened doesnt come simply locked unlocked position good sound quality pretty decent find mother squawking far less often talk also seems fairly rugged fallen stairs already dropped handful times camera much better last though difficult get pictures appreciate able use miniusb charger especially useful draining battery often im ready get rid yet bad replace early ill venture world smart phones manufacturers dont better next time buy,0,0

I am told that my voice sounds very clear during phone calls. Receptive quality is good as well. The phone and its features are easy to use. The camera quality is excellent!

It comes with a charger, and fully charges quickly. It's very comfortable to hold, and the gold finished one that I purchased is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, and believe that it is a solid investment.

samsung,"THE BEST PHONE EVER!. The title is exactly how I feel. The Note 3 is an amazing phone/tablet (or ""phablet""). I purchased it a couple of days ago to replace my Motorola Razr Maxx which I loved until it recently started to freeze and lag. I had been eying the Note 2 for some time and wanted to wait for the price to drop. I'm glad I did not rush to buy it, because now the Note 3 is out and I found it half price and brand new at BB. I have the original Galaxy Note 10.1, which I love and use consistently for work. Of course, I would love to upgrade to the 2014 edition, but first the phone, and then.... So far, I find the phone to be easy to use, blazingly fast, crystal clear display, and the S-Note app is wonderful, which tempts me to no end to lunge for the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, lol. Upon purchase, I transferred the SD card from the Razr Maxx to the Note, which brought up all my saved pictures that I had downloaded, so no need to start over. I also immediately bought the Otter Box Defender to protect this phone, as it is a worthwhile investment. The phone is quite big, but this is what I like and my hands are large enough to hold the phone comfortably. Smaller hands may find it to be a problem. The phone sounds crystal clear, the audio (using headphones) is beautiful, and I will now begin to download some of my favorite apps to expand on the enjoyment of this phone. System updates were available immediately upon turning the phone on, and the updates downloaded with no problem at all. I find the plastic screen protector with Otter Box to be quite smooth, and does not interfere with the hand or S-Pen at all. And I feel good knowing the screen (and the whole phone) is well protected. I would advise a good strong case such as Otter Box, as this phone could easily slip out of your hands, mainly because of its size, but also because it is a bit slippery. Overall I have no complaints at all, but will update this review if anything else catches my attention. Should you decide to get this phone, you will not be disappointed.

samsung,"Loaded with crap out of the box, but not bad after some changes. Do you remember that YouTube video showing what an iPod box would look like if it was made by Microsoft? The dozens of stickers and certifications and advertisements? That's what this phone feels like out of the box. It's overwhelmed with Samsung stuff, much of which serves only to drain the battery or change Android for no particular reason. The phone actually lagged and stuttered from the get-go. That's a hell of an achievement for a quad-core handset with 2GB of RAM. Since I came from a Galaxy S running Cyanogen, that just wouldn't do. SPEEDIFYING THE S4: The first step was to gain full control by rooting it. Google 'qbking77 galaxy s4 root' for an easy guide. Step two was to install 'NoBloat Free' and start disabling all the Samsung background nonsense. Search '[ROM]broodROM S4 RC1' and click the first link for a list of what's safe to ditch. Don't permanently delete anything; you'll need to re-enable these later to apply Samsung's over-the-air updates. Step three was to change the animation speed for the UI under Developer Options. To enable Developer Options, go to System Settings -> More -> About Device, scroll down, and tap on build number five or ten times. Then back up, go into Developer Options, and change the three 'X scales' near the bottom from 1X to 0.5X or Off. Step four was to ditch the TouchWiz launcher and use Nova Launcher instead. It's like a pumped-up version of the stock Android launcher and very fast. The free version does everything you'll need. Step five was to disable NFC, S Beam, Bluetooth, and so on. All that stuff is lovely, but leaving it on when you don't need it (Bluetooth in particular) does nasty things to your battery life. If you want idle time measured in days, disable location services in the Maps app. If you get 'Media Server' taking up your battery, install Rescan Media Root. That's it for performance. The phone is fairly quick now. It has about 900 MB of free memory and, if left idle, will sit for about 80 hours before the battery dies. After that, I installed a couple of useful apps like Screen Filter (to dim the screen even more at night), Waze (which has traffic rerouting and police alerts and makes my Garmin feel a million years old), F-Droid (an alternative app store that'll let you install things like AdAway) and so on. Update-- out of annoyance with inconsistent performance even after many of these tweaks, I switched to CyanogenMod 10.1. It's not quite as stable as the stock Samsung firmware, but it's so much faster. BUILD: It's a pretty handset and shockingly thin. It almost disappears even in tight (for a guy) jeans. It's also incredibly slippery. I nearly dropped it twice setting it up. Unlike my Samsung Epic (which had the delightful feature of falling into pieces when dropped and not breaking), you can crack the screen easily, so buy a case. I vowed I wasn't going to bother since the Epic never needed one. I've done a 180. After trying a few, I've been very happy with Spigen's Ultra Fit in high-grip matte black. The phone is much easier to grip now with minimal changes in thickness. Review sites say the HTC One is a prettier fetish object. I agree it feels better in hand, but there's a caveat: it can't be dismantled. If you drop it or mess up the charging port, Sprint can't fix it onsite. They have to send it back to HTC. The HTC is also chunkier, for better or worse. The screen is near-perfect. It'd be totally perfect if not for the high power use displaying white and pleasing, though somewhat inaccurate color. You'll want to use dark or night themes whenever possible. Pixels are invisible. Blacks are pitch even in darkness. The size is just on the border of too large for one-handed use. I'm over six feet with commensurately-sized hands, and pressing the side Power button while bracing with a pinky is a slight stretch. A five-foot friend loves her Note II, though, so if you're willing to treat it two-handed like a tablet, any hand size will do. AS A PHONE: Samsung included a useful app (perish the thought!) called 'Adapt Sound'. It's under System Settings -> My Device -> Sound, at the bottom. It'll test your hearing and change the frequency response of the phone to suit it. The app significantly improved the intelligibility of conversations to me. Much, much better than the Galaxy S. I did have some trouble integrating Google Voice. Sprint has a Visual Voicemail app ('VTT') with a three month trial that kept coming back from the dead and showing me old voicemails. The solution was to press and hold the Voicemail app icon from Nova Launcher and drag it up to 'Manage App' on the top left. Then I pressed 'Disable' and agreed to all the prompts when it asked to uninstall itself. Now the voicemail button in the dialer calls Google Voice. Voicemails are also transcribed and sent to my inbox per usual. TEXT INPUT: This is my first handset without a hardware keyboard. It's been a surprisingly smooth transition to screen typing. Hardware keyboards work really well for idiosyncratic speech and punctuation. If you're sufficiently pedantic to chafe at the thought of accidentally using the wrong quote marks or comma placement, no software keyboard will be a true panacea. But some are better than others. The most clever of them all is SwiftKey. First, because it'll let you seamlessly switch from tapping letters to gesture-style word tracing. Second, because it has the best text prediction, because it scrapes your email, Facebook, text messages, and Twitter to compile a personalized library of what you actually say. That one word you made up that doesn't exist in any dictionary? If you've ever used it anywhere, SwiftKey will predict it. That extends to full sentence constructions. In practice, I use word-tracing in portrait mode and rely on SwiftKey to guess correctly. With just GMail and Facebook in the database, it does so about 90% of the time if my tracing is even vaguely on point. For more unique words, I switch to landscape and use that larger keyboard to accurately touch-type. As SwiftKey learns, I find myself doing this less often. In a car, I rely on Google's voice recognition, which is superb when it works (most of the time), but often requires saying the same thing twice to fix an error six words earlier. All of this is noticeably easier on the S4's 5"" screen than it ever was on the Epic's 4"" screen. My iPhone friends continue to amaze me with their speed and accuracy, but with my large thumbs, I couldn't duplicate that with a screen keyboard on any handset before this one. ACCESSORIES: The 2.1 amp wall charger charges at 1% per minute, so a little under two hours for a full charge. Beware off-brand and car chargers. I discovered the phone charges in one of two modes: USB computer mode and dumb charger mode. USB mode (where it assumes the output device is a computer) only gives 0.5A (to stay within the USB spec), so the phone will take all night to charge. But it'll pull 2 amps or more from a dumb charger if you're not using a super-skinny USB cable. The problem is, there are two ways to make a charger appear 'dumb', and they're incompatible. The Apple way (implemented by most chargers) won't fast-charge this phone. The other way (shorting the two middle USB data pins) will, but few chargers actually use this technique (thanks to Apple's popularity). The upshot is, unless you're buying branded accessories specifically for Android phones, you're probably going to have to do minor surgery on any of the cheaper chargers you buy. SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE? Maybe. The S4 has some impressive hardware and a best-in-class screen, but the phone experience is dictated by Android. And Android is hit or miss. This phone, after I've tweaked the hell out of it, is occasionally faster than an iPhone. More often, it isn't. The iPhone screen lights up faster when you press the power button. There's very little delay after you press an app, and very little more in showing content within the app. The UI animations are smooth. Android is none of these things, and more noticeably, it's not consistent. Sometimes it's very fast, sometimes it lags, and you'll never have any idea why. And then there's the micromanagement. I'm happy that I discovered how to disable the background media scanner that was cutting 30 hours of my idle time, but I shouldn't have to do that. Windows Phone 8 is right up there with the iPhone in responsiveness. Better, even, and with a novel and impressive UI that integrates many social media functions independent of separate apps. The Windows app store is lackluster, though, and the OS itself is harder to hack if that's what you're about. You really have to be happy with how the phone works out of the box. The hardware also lags behind Android handsets, but you won't ever notice (except in some games) because the OS is so fluid. And it has terrific Exchange support for business users. For most people, unless there's a compelling need for a large screen or Android's greater abilities once rooted, the iPhone is simply better than even this S4. It doesn't require any of the tweaking I've outlined, nor the low-level task management that seems to crop up so often even with Android 4. Likewise, the Windows Phone ecosystem isn't sufficiently mature to recommend that one over the iPhone. But if you want Android and you're willing to unlock the full potential of it, the S4 is as good as it gets for this screen size.",2013-06-28,positive,5,en,loaded crap box bad changes remember youtube

samsung,"Best Smartphone Yet. I bought the S7 Edge to replace my six-month old LG V10. I liked the V10, and sadly Samsung does not use the 32bit DAC which the V10 has. But the V10's poor battery life just was too much of a problem to be used by a road warrior. The S7 Edge's battery life is substantially better. With average daily use (a few phone calls, regular email and text sending and receiving, an hour's with of Internet searching) the phone has about 30% of power left after a 16-hr day. I was concerned that the always-on screen would sap the battery. I ran a test and found that the screen eats up about one and a half percent per hour. The screen is beyond gorgeous. Colors pop. Black is black. Typefaces are razor sharp. The 5.5"" screen is a right-sized screen - - big enough to comfortably use and small enough to slide into Jean pockets without sticking up out of the pocket as a beacon to pick-pockets. The Bluetooth is solid, as is WiFi. The external speaker is loud but useless for serious listening. Serious listening requires earphones. The DAC is only 16bit (the mediocre norm), so this phone can never be more than just an okay audio playback device. The camera is excellent. The screen edge isn't nearly the gimmick I thought it was. It is actually a useful feature. I really like the always-on screen displaying the time, battery level, date, and number of messages. The fingerprint scanner works nearly 100% of the time. It will go from 40% power to 100% power in two hours using a wireless charging. Some things to consider if you are weighing getting this phone. It is really expensive, it's made of fragile glass, and it's curved edge compromises how well a protective case can protect the phone without interfering with the edge functions. I would be afraid to own this phone without carrier insurance to replace the phone in the event of owner-caused damage. I see so many reviews that rave about this phone's style and tactile feel. But it's style and slipperiness scream to have a protective case which will cover up all that style and certainly change the tactile feel.

samsung,Rugged phone but music player and bluetooth need improvement. I originally liked this phone because it's well made and easy to use. A bit thicker and heavier than other non-smart phones but feels solid and not flimsy in your hand. The two complaints I have are with the Bluetooth and music player. Seems I have to crank the volume all the way up on the phone in order to get the volume on the Bluetooth speaker to be audible in my car. I have used several phones with this car's Bluetooth and never had that problem. Similar problem with my Bluetooth headphones where one click on the phone's volume control and you go from barely audible to blasting your eardrums. The other problem is with the music player software which must have been some freeware they found. There's a long delay (about a minute) each time you access the music player. Then more delays as you navigate through the options. The music player only plays songs in numeric/alpha order so the only way to listen to an album in order is if the songs are prefixed with a number. If you're into album rock - you're screwed. I did a chat session with Samsung to confirm that was the case and that no other music player software can be installed. I also seem to be missing a bunch of artists from the playlist and can't figure that one out either as the same songs have no problem showing up in my other portable music players. So originally gave this phone like 4 stars then took one back for the Bluetooth and now another one for the music player and we're down to 2 stars.,2014-08-07,negative,2,en,rugged phone music player bluetooth need improvement originally liked phone well made easy use bit thicker heavier nonsmart phones feels solid flimsy hand two complaints bluetooth music player seems crank volume way phone order get volume bluetooth speaker audible car used several phones cars bluetooth never problem similar problem bluetooth headphones one click phones volume control go barely audible blasting eardrums problem music player software must freeware found theres long delay minute time access music player delays navigate options music player plays songs numericalpha order way listen album order songs prefixed number youre album rock youre screwed chat session samsung confirm case music player software installed also seem missing bunch artists playlist cant figure one either songs problem showing portable music players originally gave phone like stars took one back bluetooth another one music player stars,0,1

After recently becoming one of America's newest smartphone customers, I was going to pass my pristineÂ Samsung A797 Flight Red At&t Qwerty Keyboard Touch Screen 3g Gps Cell PhoneÂ to my youngest daughter until I saw this phone listed on Amazon.com. First off, the deal is crazy. Less than 25 dollars for this phone! Secondly, I like Net10, because you can switch their calling plans hassle-free! I can easily tailor my daughter's plan to her actual cell phone usage! Add a cute ""blinged-out"" phone caseÂ Samsung R355c Blue Circle Silver Jewel Bling Dazzle Diamonds Protector Straight Talk Net 10 HardCase Cover Skin NET 10 Straight TalkÂ and a phone charm, and she is in business! Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box? It doesn't support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn't going to need that yet, but it's nice to have, LOL). The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls). Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.

samsung,"Eleven things I HATE about my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Iâve read review after glowing review about Samsungâs current flagship phone, the Galaxy S7 Edge, and it makes me wonder if Iâm using the same phone that they are. I know when a new product gets reviewed, the experience is different because they only try it out for a few days before writing about it. To be fair, I rather enjoyed my new phone for the first month or so as well. But now that Iâm a few months in, itâs really starting to piss me off. Itâs almost to the point where I want to use it as a wireless hotspot for my old, deactivated iPhone 5S. Here are the eleven biggest (yes, thereâs more than eleven!) pain points Iâm experiencing with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge: BEAUTIFUL BUT HIGHLY FRAGILE These phones are engineered to break â?both your heart and the phone itself. I cannot say this emphatically enough â?Gorilla Glass is not a selling point, because it provides no protection for the delicate, breakable design of this phone. The S7 Edge has glass on the front and the back, and it will shatter at the slightest ding. We know. One of our two identical phones shattered within a week without a case. This must be protected at all times by a sturdy, impact-resistant case like an Otterbox. Thatâs a shame for a phone thatâs designed like a piece of art. BIG BATTERY, MEET POWER-HUNGRY PHONE The Galaxy S7 Edge may tout one of the largest batteries on the smartphone market, but it does little good when itâs paired with such a power-guzzling phone. I routinely â?really, at least five days a week â?go from 100% charge when I wake up to less than 50% by noon. (And thatâs on a good day.) This isnât a two day phone. If itâs a one day phone, I probably forgot it at home all day. The one saving grace is the built-in Quick Charge 2.0 capabilities, but Iâve found myself creating a network of strategically placed QC 2.0 charging banks at my most visited spots at home, at work and in my car. I even have a power bank six times bigger than the S7âs battery that I carry most of the time. STORAGE SPACE: 32 GB IS THE NEW 16 Several years ago, I got my first smartphone and my first Android phone â?Sprintâs HTC Evo. I experienced a pain back then similar to one of my biggest pains right now, which is the frustrating lack of on-board storage. The Evo rocked a staggering 1 GB of on-board storage and came with an 8 GB SD card. The problem was that so little of the on-board storage was available for apps, and not all apps supported running off an SD card. It was a constant barrage of âout of spaceâ?errors. Forget about the all the media we download or generate. There should be adequate room for the apps we use. This is, after all, a smartphone. Iâve used a 16 GB iPhone for two years, and itâs criminal that Apple had such a small phone on the market for so long. One would think the 32 GB of space on the Galaxy S7 Edge would be serviceable, but Iâm getting the same space crunch that I experienced with the Evo all over again. Iâve scaled my installed apps back to the bare minimum that I use on a somewhat regular basis, which is about 150. I donât know if that is a low or high number on average, but thatâs me. There are 109 of those that must live on the phone, including all the non-removable bloatware apps from Samsung and Verizon. Iâve moved all 40 or so apps that can be moved to the SD card. I store all photos and videos on the SD card. Iâm still under 1 GB of free space, which is rendering the phone as a whole laggy and unstable. This is not an issue unique to this phone. Most of the phones on the market are singular 32 GB models. There is the âadoptable storageâ?feature of Android Marshmallow that could ease some of these issues, but Samsung doesnât allow its use on this phone (at least, without some clever workarounds). APPS DONâT STAY PUT This is also more of an Android frustration, but exacerbated by the limited storage issues of the phone. Iâve worked so diligently to move all eligible apps to the SD card to keep my precious free space in tact. But whenever an app updates, it moves the app back to the internal memory, requiring me to move the app all over again. This is not a speedy process either, and there are certain offenders like Facebookâs portfolio of bloated apps that update allâ?theâ?time. Last night, I had 9 apps auto-update on me, which gave me a lot of work to do during breakfast this morning. Is the phone really smart if it canât remember where to store an app after it updates? THE CAMERA IS FRUSTRATINGLY UN-SNAPPY Part of the appeal of a smartphone for most â?and 90% for me â?is having a good camera with you at all times. A good percentage of the decision to do this phone instead of another iPhone was the quality of the camera, especially in low light. Unfortunately, the camera is anything but reliable. In fact, itâs downright infuriating in critical situations where I need a responsive camera at the right moment, whether thatâs a family picture or something for work. The camera has been, more often than not, totally unresponsive to taps of the shutter, and when it is responsive, there is often a delay causing blurry, unintended results. Then thereâs the video performance. Dropped frames are present on every video, no matter what resolution I shoot with. There is a noticeable delay between pressing ârecordâ?and the start of shooting, and there is almost always a delay between audio and video at the end of the recording. Other apps also seem to have negative effects on the performance of the camera. I would often get glitching and sync issues when I had Google Now set to listen in any app. Disabling that helped, but the performance of the camera is wholly disappointing, so much so that I now often carry my old deactivated iPhone 5S with me every day solely as a reliable pocket camera. ITâS A HOT MESS The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is possibly the best phone ever for people who have cold hands. Itâs gets warm a lot, and overheats several times a day, in a wide variety of everyday situations. When it goes into its âCooling Downâ?mode, performance severely degrades, which adds to the frustration of the experience. I get the times when it goes into this protective mode if the sun shines on it while itâs in my car mount, but not when itâs just sitting on my desk charging. I currently have it in a Spigen Neo Hybrid case, which has a reasonably thin silicone backing. Itâs not thick enough to cause heating issues like this. So as a phone itâs not so great, but as a hot plate for keeping your coffee warm, itâs certainly capable. STARTING OVER This thing reboots a lot on its own at random (inopportune) times, or at least it thinks it does. I canât quite make out a pattern for why it does this, but sometimes it will just up and restart itself. Then thereâs the times where it seems to restart itself without going through all the motions. Iâll try to unlock it with my fingerprint â?also a process thatâs nowhere near as snappy as they lead you to believe â?and it tells me that I must use my pattern unlock because it just restarted. Although, it didnât. That aside, youâd think that the performance would be better because itâs starting up fresh after a reboot, but youâd be wrong. TOUCHWIZ â?AFTER CHEEZ WHIZ, NOW MY LEAST FAVORITE WIZ Everybody knows by this point that Samsungâs TouchWiz interface is pretty terrible. I agree. It kills performance, is pretty ugly and not that customizable. So thereâs not much more to say about it. Luckily you can do something about it by installing a third-party launcher. I use Nova Launcher, which I mostly recommend. Thereâs so much you can do with it and it removes a lot of the friction from the user experience. My only qualm with it is some of the icons of apps on the SD card disappear when you reboot the phone. You can back up your layouts to help with that problem though. ALWAYS ON, ALWAYS KIND OF USELESS One of the biggest selling points of the Galaxy S7 and other phones of this generation is an always on display. The novelty of having a limited display of information like the clock, calendar or notifications seems like a super-handy thing, but in everyday use itâs not that big of a deal. In fact, the cost/benefit ratio considering the battery drain on an already battery-hungry device makes it seem like a non-starter. If there were more customization you could do to whatâs displayed, it might be worthwhile, but the options are pretty limited. Most often, I keep it turned off. Itâs a feature with unrealized potential, for certain. CUTTING EDGE? Speaking of features with unrealized potential, letâs talk about the Edge. You know, the curved (but barely) edges of the screen that offer convenience in ways the iPhone canât? Well, I donât think Iâve used these features more than a handful of times in the few months Iâve owned this phone, and I donât see that changing. The Edge Panels are not all that useful, at least any more so than getting to the intended places faster than just navigating there through regular means. There are a couple things like a ruler that are handy in extremely limited circumstances, but not enough to justify going with the Edge over the regular S7. In fact, the main reason I went with the Edge was the slightly bigger screen. That said, itâs really not great for watching full-screen content, as there is some color degradation on â?and due to â?the edges when watching brightly-colored images. Thereâs no reason for the curve except maybe seeing color strobing when you receive a notification and the phone is face-down, but with an always on display and wireless charging, I never keep it face down. If anything, the curve exists to make the phone more fragile, and it does that remarkably well. SAMSUNG PAY â?NO, SAMSUNG, PAY MORE ATTENTION TO SUPPORTING THIS FEATURE I was really looking forward to the day I could leave my wallet in my pocket and use my phone to pay for stuff. Samsung was looking forward to that day too, and has offered multiple incentives to get people using the feature. Unfortunately, theyâve done an astoundingly-poor job of getting banks on-board to support Samsung Pay. I have a lot of cards in my wallet (from both local and national institutions), and I donât think a single one is supported. Iâd love to use Samsung Pay someday, if they ever let me. There was a brief, shining moment where I did actually use the app though. They started allowing you to store membership and loyalty cards in the app. These cards flood my keychain and my wallet, so I was thrilled to be able to add them to my phone. Certain ones like my Costco card are natively supported, while others like my library cards worked by manual addition. I got them all programmed in and ready to go, and I used it once at a grocery store, much to my delight. Then I went the second time to a grocery store with famously poor cell reception and my cards would not work whatsoever. Shortly thereafter, an update occurred and my entire portfolio of cards disappeared, never to be seen again. That was the end of that experiment. IN CONCLUSION, I HATE THIS PHONE WITH A PASSION I love Android so much better than iPhone for a host of reasons, and I had such high hopes that my original Android experience would turn around with improved hardware. Unfortunately, if this phone is any indication, Android hasnât matured quite yet and the hardware is largely to blame. For being the Cadillac of Android smartphones in 2016, I find myself dumbfounded as to why my experience is so overwhelmingly negative. I find myself now counting the months and days until Iâm eligible to upgrade out of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge into a more stable, capable smartphone, and I really wish that wasnât the

Benefits of the Note 5 are that it feels like a much nicer phone than the previous models. Screen size has stayed consistent and is nice when your vision is sub-par. charging port and audio jack have not shown any signs of wear after 7 months of use. The phone originally shipped with lollipop but I received the marshmellow update after about 5 months of having the device (around march is when it updated). After the update the battery life has decreased noticeably. The screen does not scratch easily even without a screen protector. I did purchase one but the glass screen protector broke shortly after putting it on the phone.

samsung,"Won't work in the USA. This phone uses Global System for Mobiles (GSM) instead of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). 80% of US phone carriers don't use GSM; the only big ones who do are AT&T and T-Mobile. Nowhere on this product page does it specify this information, so when I received the phone and was unable to activate it, I was rather annoyed. It took a lot of searching to figure out what the problem was. I was able to return the phone with no problem, then I just went to Best Buy and bought it there. As for the item I received through this seller on Amazon, everything looked new and it included accessories that I hadn't expected (thought I can't remember what they were now). It did boot up in Spanish; not sure what that was about. Anyway, double check with your phone service provider to make sure they use GSM before you buy this phone from this seller.",2019-06-17,negative,1,en,wont work usa phone uses global system mobiles gsm instead code division multiple access cdma us phone carriers dont use gsm big ones att tmobile nowhere product page specify information received phone unable activate rather annoyed took lot searching figure problem able return phone problem went best buy bought item received seller amazon everything looked new included accessories hadnt expected thought cant remember boot spanish sure anyway double check phone service provider make sure use gsm buy phone seller,0,0
samsung,"I really wanted to like this phone.... I bought this GSM unlocked phone to use for travel in Europe. I really wanted to like this phone. The phone has four processors. Operation was fast and slick. It was the right size (small). I loved the Lollipop operating system. Everything worked like a champ....except...I could not get it to connect to my router. However, it was able to instantly connect to a nearby public router. Thought there was something wrong related to modem security, so turned WPA2 off. No dice. Did soft resets, hard resets, turned WiFi on and off, tested every channel on the modem, and did about two dozen other checks and tests over the space of about 12 hours. Well, someone will say ""there's an incompatibility with your modem."" And, yes, that may be. But there are eight other devices that regularly connect and disconnect from my modem (and MAC filtering is not turned on) without a hint of trouble. So, it's just not worth it to throw out my modem, get a new one, set that up, and reconfigure eight other devices just to test this theory out. If it works for you, I am sure you will enjoy using it. Incidentally, mine came with a European charger plug configuration, but included a USA adapter. Nice thinking on the part of Samsung.",2016-06-18,neutral,3,en,really wanted like phone bought gsm unlocked phone use travel europe really wanted like phone phone four processors operation fast slick right size small loved lollipop operating system everything worked like champexcepti could get connect router however able instantly connect nearby public router thought something wrong related modem security turned wpa dice soft resets hard resets turned wifi tested every channel modem two dozen checks tests space hours well someone say theres incompatibility modem yes may eight devices regularly connect disconnect modem mac filtering turned without hint trouble worth throw modem get new one set reconfigure eight devices test theory works sure enjoy using incidentally mine came european charger plug configuration included usa adapter nice thinking part samsung,1,2

samsung,"Samsung hits an inside-the-park home run. The only reason it's inside-the-park is because the Galaxy Note 3 is the blast over the green monster. The way I judge a smartphone's awesomeness is how easy it is to use, how well it integrates into your everyday life, and how it offers pleasant diversions for the down time. Using these three criteria, the S4 succeeds in all of them. The phone is extremely easy to use There has been much debate over which operating system is the best, with a large number of people criticizing Samsung's TouchWhiz as being clunky, outdated, and intrusive. I disagree. In my experience, TouchWhiz has proven to be fast, feature rich, and pleasant to use. Everything I do on a daily basis is quick and intuitive. Benchmark scores (Quadrant and Linpack) prove that, at least as far as the numbers go, the S4 equals or bests most other phones on the market.

samsung,"Windows Phone 7 is great, Samsung Focus is solid, DOES come unlocked, but has suspicious packaging. Straight from the vendor the phone is, in fact, unlocked (we use it on T-Mobile, but it should work with any GSM network with a SIM card, but NOT Verizon or Sprint or CDMA networks). This is our second Samsung Focus (the first was directly through Amazonwireless) and we love this phone! AT&T has dropped the ball big-time on updates, however, and you can only upgrade it to WP 7.5 Mango. There are several security/bug fix updates in between WP 7.5 and 7.8 that AT&T will not allow Microsoft to push to your phone, but overall this is a great entry-level smart phone and you simply cannot beat the price now that it has been out a couple of years. Since the phone is branded to AT&T (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER). Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have ""Samsung"" or ""AT&T"" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker. The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly, had a normal flashy orange AT&T box with Samsung written all over it. The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T on it. To make matters worse, the little info sticker with the serial numbers on it below the battery does NOT say Samsung on it (unlike our first Samsung Focus directly from Amazonwireless did). When I first got the package, it screamed COUNTERFEIT to me. ***see update below*** But upon opening it, the phone appears to be constructed the same. I powered on and set up the phone and then installed a Benchmark app on it, and it performs the same as my original Focus does. To top it off, I called Samsung directly and told them about my concerns. After describing everything to them and even giving them my phone's IMEI number (serial number), they assured me that it was a genuine Samsung product (but the representative had no explanation for why the packaging looked so suspicious). In any event, the phone itself is a solid 5 stars. AT&T gets 1 star for neglecting their customers by not allowing security and bug fixes on phones they offer (which is partially why we switched carriers in the first place). But because of the update issue and the unusual packaging, I dinged the phone down to 4 stars. But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO). ***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor. That got me thinking that perhaps the phone was refurbished rather than brand new (which might also explain the knock-off looking non-Samsung box). I did some reasearch and have come to the conclusion that I almost certainly received a refurbished phone (an internet search on how to spot refurbished phones was VERY helpful). The seller had good customer service though and sent us a label to send back the defective phone and sent another ""new"" one at no charge. This ""new"" phone was actually in the factory Samsung box this time. However, the box was scratched and the phone itself also had other tell-tale signs of being refurbished (although if I hadn't researched the topic it would have appeared brand new to me). This time around, however, I ran diagnostics on the phone the moment I opened the box and set up the OS and everything seems to be working perfectly. A final follow-up question to the seller about whether they might be getting supplied with refurbished phones instead of ""new"" phones from their supplier has so far gone unanswered, but I'm almost positive that's what is happening here. I can't be too mad because the price we paid for the supposedly ""new"" phone was actually less than other sellers were charging for a refurbished phone, but a little bit of honesty here would be nice. In any event, I encourage you to research how to spot a refurbished phone on the interet for more information. In my non-expert opinion, in retrospect, I highly doubt any carrier-branded phone (i.e. with AT&T logo on the front) can come factory unlocked. So if you see a listing for ""unlocked"" and ""new"" in the same sentence, I personally doubt the accuracy of that listing and urge you to contact the seller in advance to double check. When phones come back from the factory after service work, or they get refurbished to be resold, it is a well-documented fact that they are usually unlocked at THAT point. So be forewarned, if a carrier-branded phone is ""new"" it is most likely locked, and if a carrier-branded phone is unlocked, it is most likely not new. I have lowered the rating down to 3 stars due to what I think is likely inaccurate marketing.",2013-02-28,neutral,3,en,windows phone great samsung focus solid come unlocked suspicious packaging straight vendor phone fact unlocked use tmobile work gsm network sim card verizon sprint cdma networks second samsung focus first directly amazonwireless love phone att dropped ball bigtime updates however upgrade wp mango several securitybug fix updates wp att allow microsoft push phone overall great entrylevel smart phone simply cannot beat price couple years since phone branded att even though unlocked used gsm network simply able get updates phone att decides bless likelihood based history never also box phone came sealed samsung att anywhere box except printed sticker original focus got amazonwireless directly normal flashy orange att box samsung written product manual inside new unlocked phones box also suspiciously say samsung att make matters worse little info sticker serial numbers battery say samsung unlike first samsung focus directly amazonwireless first got package screamed counterfeit see update upon opening phone appears constructed powered set phone installed benchmark app performs original focus top called samsung directly told concerns describing everything even giving phones imei number serial number assured genuine samsung product representative explanation packaging looked suspicious event phone solid stars att gets star neglecting customers allowing security bug fixes phones offer partially switched carriers first place update issue unusual packaging dinged phone stars like said entrylevel smart phone without extending contract simply cannot beat price whole windows phone system wonderfully refreshing alternative android apple imho update received focus appeared work perfectly time wrote original review tried take picture phone week owning large yellowdiscolored area center screen someone tried take picture sun something insane like burned image sensor got thinking perhaps phone refurbished rather brand new might also explain knockoff looking nonsamsung box reasearch come conclusion almost certainly received refurbished phone internet search spot refurbished phones helpful seller good customer service though sent us label send back defective phone sent another new one charge new phone actually factory samsung box time however box scratched phone also telltale signs refurbished although hadnt researched topic would appeared brand new time around however ran diagnostics phone moment opened box set os everything seems working perfectly final followup question seller whether might getting supplied refurbished phones instead new phones supplier far gone unanswered im almost positive thats happening cant mad price paid supposedly new phone actually less sellers charging refurbished phone little bit honesty would nice event encourage research spot refurbished phone interet information nonexpert opinion retrospect highly doubt carrierbranded phone ie att logo front come factory unlocked see listing unlocked new sentence personally doubt accuracy listing urge contact seller advance double check phones come back factory service work get refurbished resold welldocumented fact usually unlocked point forewarned carrierbranded phone new likely locked carrierbranded phone unlocked likely new lowered rating stars due think likely inaccurate marketing,1,2

samsung,"Samsung beats Apple on design?. Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do. But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated. Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design. Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasnât announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch? Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner! I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - Iâm all over that Galaxy Note 8! Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features arenât things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.

samsung,"Forced Software Updates Might Wipe Phone Entirely. I've had this model for about a year, but recently there was a software update - as I didn't notice it until I was leaving for work, I held off on updating until I got back home to ensure it didn't use any of my data to download. When I got back and checked my phone, it was bricked. Specifically, the lock screen had turned into an 'Unlock Encryption' screen; I had turned off encryption as soon as I got it, as I use my phone for calling/texting, and using a map service, with only rarely sensitive information like bank logins and such because I have a computer for that stuff. But anyway, since I had never set an encryption code to unlock, I couldn't unlock it. When I searched online, many people with the same issue ended up having to factory reset their phone, or managed to get through and the phone reset anyway; I was able to get it backed up at a Best Buy service center so I didn't lose the photos and contacts on it, and almost had to reset my phone as well. Thanks to the service people, we were able to figure out the issue was the update got forced through, and that my lock screen pin unlocked it! Well, it hadn't updated yet, in actuality - not until I put in my pin did it download anything. I'm glad it's working again, but if updates are going to keep doing this and get forced through, I'm switching to a different brand of phone at Christmas, even if it means a non-sim card phone.",2018-10-06,negative,1,en,forced software updates might wipe phone entirely ive model year recently software update didnt notice leaving work held updating got back home ensure didnt use data download got back checked phone bricked specifically lock screen turned unlock encryption screen turned encryption soon got use phone callingtexting using map service rarely sensitive information like bank logins computer stuff anyway since never set encryption code unlock couldnt unlock searched online many people issue ended factory reset phone managed get phone reset anyway able get backed best buy service center didnt lose photos contacts almost reset phone well thanks service people able figure issue update got forced lock screen pin unlocked well hadnt updated yet actuality put pin download anything im glad working updates going keep get forced im switching different brand phone christmas even means nonsim card phone,0,0

When the phone arrived it was the midnight black edition and I could tell that it was not a new phone. The box was all beat up and there were things missing from inside the box that would normally come with a new phone. Also it looked like the head phones had been used and then repackaged. To confirm what I was thinking I went ahead and ordered a factory unlocked phone from Samsung and sold the one I had just received to another vendor. Turns out the phone was an AT&T phone and not an unlocked phone from the factory as stated in the product description.

samsung,"Great phone, great battery, just don't utilize the pen as much as I should. My previous phone was the S8 plus. The screen in the note 9 is similar in size and quality which is fine because I love that screen. The biggest improvement is the battery life, I can use the phone all day long including for navigation to and from work and still come home with over 60% of my battery left. Of course I bought the note 9 for the s pen but sadly I don't utilize it as much as I should. I'm not sure why that is but I just can't often find a compelling reason to use it. My favorite feature of the pain is the fact that you can use it as a remote to trigger the camera which is great for group shots if you can find something to prop your phone on. Speaking of the camera, it is absolutely amazing! I virtually completely stopped using my DSLR camera because the quality is so similar and I can't justify the extra weight and size (now if you're doing long-range telephoto shots or super fast sports shots there's no match for the DSLR). If I had one criticism for this phone it would be that the reception is not quite as good as it was on the S8. The processing speed and the features are all excellent.

Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone. In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ?button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible. This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use! One other function they did away with - because of the âHomeâ?button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot. Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to! The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR. When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâve been HOOKED! I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâs low-light capabilities of it's predecessors! In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in âCameraâ?. I love that as an inner (or Yelp) âFoodiesâ? I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased! Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with! Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets! As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities. I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my âTalk and Surfâ?function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâs a toss up! As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.

I was so disappointed because I LOVED the S-Pen and it's functionality. The very first Note was nice, but the pen was still new and had some issues with accuracy among other things. After several different versions, those issues had been dealt with and the pen was now just as accurate as writing with a pen or pencil. I went into the Samsung store the other day not sure if I was going to get the S10 + or the Note. I debated in my head over and over and looked at the differences and pluses and minuses and decided to go with the Note. Sure, the in-screen fingerprint reader is pretty dang cool, and the larger screen-to-body ratio is better than ever, but dang it, the S10 didn't have that pen. So I went with the Note. I am VERY happy I did. I have been a mobile junkie for a long time. I keep up on technology and when I researched the two, found the major differences between both phones were pretty minor. Speed was negligible at best. They both were running Android Pie (which I LOVE BTW) and were remarkably snappy and efficient. Samsung has come a long way since the S6+ I got many years ago--which I also loved. The edge feature is less pronounced than it was back then, but that's okay. The edge panel is still useful, but if I'm being honest, it's more of a gimmick than anything. The truth is, I DO use it, but not that much. Despite that, I still love the curved edges. I know not everyone does, but I think they look cool and it gives the screen a more immersive feel in my opinion. My phone updated to Pie almost immediately after being turned on. I must say, it is a nice upgrade. Prior to getting the Note I had the LG G7, which was okay. I even had done my best to convince myself it was actually pretty good, but the truth is, I never truly liked it after having owned the S6, S7 and S8. LG's abysmal track record of updating continues to disappoint. Every friend who owned an android had received the Pie update, but here it is August 2019 and even though LG promised quicker updates and that we'd receive android 9.0 in the first quarter of the year, it never materialized (big shocker). I was disappointed in the phones performance, too. At the very first, it seemed pretty good...but noticed early on issues that I had never seen with my Samsung phones. Suffice it to say, upgrading to the Note was a nice change of pace. Samsung One UI is surprisingly smooth and impressively less intrusive than their previous versions of Android have been...even though I never really disliked it to begin with. While it isn't pure Android, One UI still operates wonderfully and is geared more towards a smoother user experience than ever before. Many intuitive additions have made it better, as well. Couple that with the new gesture controls and I love it more than I ever thought I would. Whether you like Android or iOS, the ONE major thing that people point out the most as being the best feature of Android is customization, and the Note 9 provides that and much more. Want to rearrange the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen? Sure, no prob. Want to get rid of them in favor of gesture controls? Go for it. By the way, I will be the first to admit Samsung borrowed the gestures from iOS, and I have no problem with that since iOS has borrowed just as much from Android over the years. It's only fair. I was worried I wouldn't like gestures, but after less than a day of using them, I was hooked. It gives you more screen real estate, too. Albeit not a huge amount, but more is more, right? They also work perfectly, too. Instead of pressing the button to go back, or to the home screen or recent apps, just swipe up from the left, middle or right portion of the very bottom of the screen. They work great and this is far and away my favorite new aspect of Android Pie. If I'm being honest, I am not a huge fan of iris scan to unlock my phone. Now adding the combination of using iris and face recognition helps improve accuracy and definitely IS faster, but I wish that Samsung would hurry up with the face ID more similar to iOS, which is the best out there bar none and is MUCH faster than Iris/face unlock on my Note. All things considered, I'd stick with it and also have a fingerprint reader too than not one at all like iPhones are forced to deal without. The fingerprint reader is still accurate and VERY fast, so if that doesn't bug you, then at least that is a nice option. I do wish they had placed the fingerprint reader on back about a good inch lower. Being so close to the camera lenses can sometimes make it a pain to not smudge the cameras trying to feel around for it. You'll get it right after a bit of practice, but I still accidentally hit it now and again, so keep that in mind. Bixby is as useless as ever. I'm glad that they now make it easy to remap the Bixby button so it can open Google instead, which is infinitely better. Don't get me wrong, there are some things Bixby does that is every bit as convenient as Google, but in every single instance I've ever tried it, Google was faster. Sometimes MUCH faster. Not sure why their own AI is so far behind and it never seems to get better, but oh well. At least the option is there, right? The speakers are SO much better than every previous Samsung I have ever used. Are they the best out there? Sorry but no. They finally have stereo speakers which is a move in the right direction. The bottom speaker facing down vs the earpiece facing towards you makes that experience a bit un-even, but hey, nothings perfect, right? It's still much better than my S8 and every other phone I have personally used in the past. Yes, the phone is big. It can--at times--be a challenge to navigate with one hand. Thankfully Samsung gives you the ability to use it one-handed where you swipe up diagonally from the corner and it shrinks the screen to whichever side you swiped it from for simple and easy one-handed use. With that being said, I wish many options were closer to the bottom of the screen for easier reach with my thumb instead towards the very top of the screen. I've heard this was one area where Samsung had specifically worked to make easier, but personally I haven't really seen how that is the case, even with the newest update. Even so, that changes nothing--I still love my phone and knew this was going to be the case when I bought it, so the only way you should be upset is if you bought the phone without having done enough research to make sure you were aware of stuff like this in advance...in which case, that's on you. Keep in mind this big phone has an absolutely gorgeous screen that does not disappoint. It gets plenty bright and simply looks brilliant. Watching video is a joy and I love how you can record video and use it for your lock screen, even video you shoot in 4K, though I'm not sure why you'd do that because since the phone screen isn't 4K there is no need to use it for your lock screen. Full HD is good enough and looks awesome and adds an extra level of personal customization that iOS cannot match. The S-Pen is truly a work of art this time. If you have time, Google artwork on Note phones. You'll be amazed the level of artistic ability the pen now offers. It really is like writing with a regular pen or pencil. It now has over 4,000 levels of pressure points to increase it's accuracy and smoothness and boy can you tell. The moment you eject the pen, you immediately have your options come out with a cool little animation. You have Create Note, View all notes, Smart select, Screen write, Live message, Translate, Penup and Add shortcuts. I love how you can pull the pen out without turning the phone on and you can take a quick note directly on the screen and save it without having to turn on anything. VERY convenient. I also love the Live message feature. Create your own GIFs that are personalized and look great. I love this feature. The reality is that the S-Pen is the ONE feature which truly sets the Note apart from almost all other devices (save a few LG devices which are generally very poor by comparison). If you don't plan to use the S-Pen then there really is no point in getting a Note device at all, really. If you don't feel you'd use it, I would recommend getting something else. In business these days that S-Pen can be absolutely invaluable. From taking quick notes to signing a document, highlighting almost anything and even copying something that other phones are incapable of doing. The uses are really quite vast--but only if you really plan to take advantage of them, otherwise it's a waste if I'm being honest. Keep that in mind before you buy. Performance is very impressive. I have noticed a very noticeable jump in performance over my G7 (which wasn't hard to do since after 8 months, it was so disappointingly slow and buggy that I will most likely never own another LG phone. When I say impressive performance though, I really mean it. Apps open quickly. Getting into settings is a very quick and simple procedure that requires only a few steps. I love the themes that you can download from Samsung. Some are truly awesome and you can find some really cool free one's, too. Even new icon packages and Always On Display options make this the most customizable phone I've ever seen. The camera is fantastic. Is it the best on the market? Probably not. However when it came out it was one of the best you could buy. Updates have only improves this. I'm still waiting for the Night Mode that Samsung put into the S10 which is supposedly coming to the Note 9 and S9's. Wide angle and even AR emoji's (Samsungs version of Animoji's from iOS), which are not bad, but not quite as smooth as you'll get with apple devices. I love the fact that this will be the last Note to probably come with a 3.5mm headphone jack since the Note 10 has officially dumped it in favor of a slightly larger battery (4300 mAh over the 4000 mAh in the Note 9). I have several truly wireless earbuds and with bluetooth 5.0 audio really does sound pretty great, so it's not a huge loss, but I can still use my Bose wired earbuds if I so choose which is a nice option since they still have killer audio. For some this will be a big deal not having the headphone jack, but for me it's not a deal breaker. If the Note 10 had been available when I went in to get the Note 9 I definitely would have gotten it, with or without the jack. But it's something to keep in mind for those who care about it. The expansion slot is still there, but I doubt I'll really need it since I have never used more than 40 GB of memory ever on any phone I've owned. Again, it's nice to have just in case. All in all I am VERY happy with the Note 9 and since it was such a dramatic upgrade over the LG G7 it's almost laughable by comparison. No offense to LG but your promise to improve the frequency of updates, but then no actual ACTION on your part just makes you look like a big liar. It seems like every year LG's slice of the mobile market gets a little smaller and yet their ability to innovate and improve continues to fall by the wayside along with unfulfilled promises...and with that being the case, they need to expect that this trend will only accelerate in the future. Sorry guys. The last two times I gambled on buying one of your phones (the G4 and the G7) I have been severely disappointed (though I preferred the G4 overall more than the G7). Samsung is in a class by itself...though I must say, I was disappointed that they didn't offer at least a 90 Hz screen (like the OnePlus 7 Pro) with the new Note 10. Maybe next year? For those wondering whether or not the Note 9 is still worth the buy, I can emphatically say that YES it is. Since the Note 10 just was officially announced, you may even get the Note 9 at a significant price reduction so that is another reason to consider it, especially if you're looking to save a few dollars--and considering what the Note 10 costs, even the smaller version, that can be a significant savings. Good luck and I hope my review was helpful in some small way.",2019-08-08,positive,5,en,favorite phone date owned first samsung note came around years ago loved next opportunity get another one

samsung,"My first real smart phone. I'm behind the times. I just got my first nice smart phone and am enjoying it. I never had the money for one before, so I have nothing to compare this with... but I decided since I now had the money to buy a nice phone, I'd get something really, really nice - and after a lot of research into iPhones and Samsung phones, I chose this beautiful Samsung Note9 and I'm very pleased with my choice. I've had no problems with it. This phone is so fast! Also, I bought a lot of memory... 512GB, which is expandable with a memory card. I got the extra memory because I'm going to be making YouTube videos with this after I start traveling... or maybe before. As soon as I can figure out how to do it. I saw a few YouTube reviews of this phone and two featured broken phones... I mean, the glass broke when they dropped it or banged it against something. So I decided from the beginning to get a good quality protective case with a screen protector, and I haven't had any trouble with breakage. It may help that I haven't dropped it or anything like that. I did accidentally bang it on the edge of my table, but it didn't break. I'm grateful because I spent a lot of money on this phone. I don't know why this phone costs so much. I thought it was excessive. I am still perplexed, even though it is an awesome phone. It cost more than my laptop computer! How can this be right? Please leave me a comment if you know why the phone is more expensive than a laptop computer. Nevertheless, I don't resent the expenditure. The phone has a large screen and works very fast. Flawlessly, so far. I initially took this phone to my local Verizon store to get it connected, but the man working there wasn't happy. He asked, rather gruffly, ""Where did you get that phone?"" I told him I got it from Amazon! Then he said, ""We can't connect that, we've done it before, and it just doesn't work right. We don't have any SIM cards for it."" I was shocked that he would not help me connect with Verizon! So I left. I phoned my daughter and told her about that, and she said she'd help me. She used to work at the Walmart cell phone sales area and knew a bit about cell phones. She took me to a different Verizon store near where she lives, and the young man there was very nice about connecting my phone to the network. He said his store is owned by the company, and the other Verizon stores are like franchises owned privately. So the store owner in Post Falls, Idaho wouldn't help me because he couldn't sell me a phone, but the company store hooked me up just fine, and of course, gave me a SIM card. Anyhow, I'm getting used to the cell phone. Really, I wish I could have had a good phone years ago, but better late than never. I will need it to stay in touch with relatives as I'll be traveling full-time in a few months.",2019-01-07,positive,5,en,first real smart phone im behind times got first nice smart phone enjoying never money one nothing compare decided since money buy nice phone id get something really really nice lot research iphones samsung phones chose beautiful samsung note im pleased choice ive problems phone fast also bought lot memory gb expandable memory card got extra memory im going making youtube videos start traveling maybe soon figure saw youtube reviews phone two featured broken phones mean glass broke dropped banged something decided beginning get good quality protective case screen protector havent trouble breakage may help havent dropped anything like accidentally bang edge table didnt break im grateful spent lot money phone dont know phone costs much thought excessive still perplexed even though awesome phone cost laptop computer right please leave comment know phone expensive laptop computer nevertheless dont resent expenditure phone large screen works fast flawlessly far initially took phone local verizon store get connected man working wasnt happy asked rather gruffly get phone told got amazon said cant connect weve done doesnt work right dont sim cards shocked would help connect verizon left phoned daughter told said shed help used work walmart cell phone sales area knew bit cell phones took different verizon store near lives young man nice connecting phone network said store owned company verizon stores like franchises owned privately store owner post falls idaho wouldnt help couldnt sell phone company store hooked fine course gave sim card anyhow im getting used cell phone really wish could good phone years ago better late never need stay touch relatives ill traveling fulltime months,2,2

samsung,"Looks new untouched, but it had major problems.. When I unboxed it I was excited to see a brand new uncirculated Samsung Galaxy s7 gold and beautiful. I can't afford a spanking new S10 right now at $1400, or even a S9 at $900. So I was very excited to get a very large ""upgrade"" from my 8 year old S4 with a cracked screen, but still functioning excellently. I had no problem with the appointment at Sprint and left with the phone working fine. 2 hours later I was going to make a call and I noticed the phone turning on and off, continuously rebooting and it was burning hot to the touch. I shut it down and took it back to Sprint. The repair techs checked it out, reset it factory fresh re-loaded my life back on it and it was good to go. It worked great again for about an hour before it started doing the same thing. Needless to say that I spent 3 days at Sprint with numerous technicians with always the same result, the outcome being settling on a NEW Galaxy A50. A good phone, but not a ""S"" phone. It still does more than my old S4. An I have to say that Sprint and there sales associates suck, so does Sprint. I won't have their service much longer. After 9 years as a customer they showed me how much they care about customer retention. This phone caused a lot of headaches and wasted time, not having my communication device for several days, heavy duty stress levels and missed work and missed time with my family and friends. The seller is not at fault unless they knew the phone was faulty. My lesson was buy a phone local and new from the box. I have returned the phone for a refund but still I have taken a loss adding up the return shipping, all the lost time and travel trying to get it to work. I will take it as ""stupid tax"" for buying a phone online.

samsung,"Still learning, transitioning from iPhone. Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides. Excellent battery. I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed: What I do love: Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures. Great battery life. I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day. This I abuse and it still gets me through the day. It also has a removable battery for instant juice. Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure. Responsive In my transition, things I have noticed: -Native list syncing is not present. I decided to go with Wunderlist. I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet. -No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen. The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was. You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked. If it is unlocked, you have to find the app. There is a buttonless voice activation (""Hi Galaxy""), but it stops working sometimes. -Google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen. When you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iPhone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice). -Some apps tend to freeze. I simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it. -The text size kept changing on me every time I tried to text. I found you change the default text size with the volume buttons. -I had to be creative to migrate my contacts. I moved everything to Google from my iPhone, then synced with my phone. One thing that is great is that I can manage my contacts now through Google Contacts through my Gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts! -Text to speech engine is awesome, better than Siri in accuracy and speed, I think. -Camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iPhone, UNLESS you disable security. I've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers I write afterwards, which is really nice. After the novelty of the pen, I reverted to using the on-screen keyboard. I still use it on occasion. I like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps. I have used the S-Note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice. I just wish there was more integration, so I can see my notebooks on my computer. For a case, I used the Otterbox Commuter, which works well. It has no belt clip, but I would imagine I'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway. This just slides into my pocket. Did I enjoy my iPhone? yes. simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life. Do I enjoy the Galaxy Note? yes. Totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video. It's not as well integrated, but it works and does what I want. In a mobile computing device/phone that I have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience. Will I stay? I think so. I will learn the phone soon enough. The experience is just different. If you have any comments, please do! I'm still learning the phone.

samsung,"Better value than the Note8. I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper. So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward. I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone. I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box. All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!",2017-10-26,positive,5,en,better value note waited recently purchase original intention get note upon release waiting year aborted note however things considered difficult justify price new note almost whereas amazon markedly cheaper decision made happy phone desperate need upgrade model got keen larger screen screen job large enough watch videos etc big feels awkward havent spent much time using camera yet certainly better old phone sure stacks wifes iphone android ecosystem phone worked seamlessly gear watch box told believe phone still state art represents good value money sure much mobile device manufacturers go new models level imho makes sense wait purchase slightly dated phone slightly discounted price still get lots bang mobile buck,2,2

Maybe it could be remapped to be a fully functional power button since my phone doesn't have one? -Pictures sent via text message take 5+ minutes to send, fail, and then resend in a minute. -Battery life is getting worse with every update, I used to be able to use my phone over a 48 hour period without charging. Now I have to charge it every 24 hours or less. -Automatic brightness that adjusts to your patterns is a nice feature. However, in sunlight it defaults to max brightness and you cannot change it. Compared to the S7 this phone is nowhere near as bright. I frequently have problems seeing the screen at max brightness, blacks blend together and any dark movies are unwatchable. -Audio is acceptable, you can't expect much from a single speaker on the bottom right of the phone...

Any background noise beyond a fan will make it difficult if not impossible to hear dialogue in a movie at max volume. -Auto rotate works when it wants to, never when you want it to. -Word prediction and swyping on this phone is as bad if not worse than previous Galaxy models.

samsung,Good phone but Poor battery design and Poor Samsung support. My last phone was an old slider phone from Samsung that I had for years until I saw the Galaxy S7 released. The specifications on the S7 looked good and nothing was wrong with my old phone but decided to upgrade. The S7 was great to use and had edged out comparable iPhones in terms of its ability to increase memory capability by adding MicroSD cards and its camera images are clearer and crisper than any iPhone images I have seen. The phone is what you would expect from a company like Samsung edging out its competitors with a better phone. Fast forward 16 months and not expecting problems with phone but have seen recent problems in the news with Samsung smartphone having battery problems but did not expect it with the S7. With my phone I have recently noticed that it would not last long in the Oculus 3D headset without the phone over heating due to the CPU load needed to generate 3D images. My S7 developed a separation of the case and the screen from the phone body on the left hand side of the phone due to the lithium battery swelling. The phones lithium battery is located on the left side of the phone. I have attached a picture showing the separation of the case from the body of the phone. The screen is also separated but not apparent from the angle of this picture. I notified Samsung of the problem and they did not offer to help resolve this problem beyond me sending my phone in and me paying for out of warranty repair costs. I had my phone repaired by a local repair shop which indicated they were swamped by Samsung smart phone battery repairs. The lithium batteries in these phone swell and the tolerances inside the phones as so tight that the back case and screen separate from the phone body. For a quality phone from Samsung one would expect these batteries to last longer than 16 months. Samsung customer support should recognize there is a problem and recall these phones before someone is injured. I did not get any satisfaction with Samsung customer support which seems to me that they are putting their customers and reputation in the background. For this I give this product 1 star.

samsung,"audio and cell reception quite excellent. I have T Mobile service and was worrying .... This Samsung device receives 9.5 from me. I have had an issue with almost every apple iPhone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions. I was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing. Also with the last IPhone 6S I had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%. This S8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance. There is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch. Color calibration to app resolution, video games to Microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty. Call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent. I have T Mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from LTE down to 4G or 3. Not once does it drop from LTE speeds. I know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio. This doesn't bother me. If you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in Camera app. Almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit. This feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable. The only complain I have is with the AKG ear phones the phone comes with. Ear buds do not have a good bass.

samsung,"I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+. Operating System: If youâre a Samsung user, or even if youâve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+. This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up. This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it. User Interface: This phone also has very friendly user interface. You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with. Battery Life: The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsungâs in the past. Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life. There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better. One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the âalways on displayâ? this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life. Water Resistant: This is a great feature to have on a phone. You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places. You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone. Fast Charging: You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible. Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use. With this charger your phone will be charged in no time. Bixby: The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and itâs supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone. This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free. The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off.",2017-09-12,positive,4,en,highly recommend samsung galaxy operating system youare samsung user even youave never owned samsung past highly recommend samsung galaxy phone far fastest operating phone samsung ever made perfect phone someone spends high amount time phone wants speed phone able keep phones operating system slow able handle anything throw user interface phone also friendly user interface make easy want hand make customization complex setting many people enjoy toy around battery life battery life phones seems incredible compared samsungas past even social media snapchat browsing internet several hours day usually end day battery life many settings toy around make battery better one thing able shut improve battery life aalways displaya feature always shows time uses unnecessary battery life water resistant great feature phone never phone accidentally drop phone toilet river wet places enjoy water resistant feature phone able fetch water damage done phone fast charging want get phone fast charger possible everyone hates waiting phone charge really need use charger phone charged time bixby bixby button phone feature tell commands itas supposed perform whatever task tell within phone nice feature would driving really anything needs hand free one negative thing button directly volume buttons often gets bumped accident goes,2,2

samsung,"Not Something Iâd Trust for Everyday Use. This is a decent phone, but it's pretty clear that it's not made for the American market. I have no idea if this actually works with American ATT, Verizon, or any other service provider because I bought this phone as a software developer; I purchased this phone to test my apps on. Normally when I buy phones like this I don't bother writing reviews because normally I buy the bottom of the barrel garbage phones. But this time around I figured I'd spend the extra $50 to get a decent phone such as this one... First of all the screen on this phone is absolutely beautiful. I use an iPhone 7+ as my daily phone (I know, I'm due for an upgrade...) just to set the tone. This phone's screen is great. The ""notch"" is tiny and only takes up the size of a webcam lens on a phone, to give you an idea. It's small. My main complain, the reason I give this a 2 star review, is because I'm almost 100% sure this phone is designed to work overseas without ANY INDICATION ON AMAZON. Shame on Amazon for selling this product with no indication that this is international only. I've seen SEVERAL similar postings on Amazon for $150 which clearly call out that what they're selling is the ""international version"" but this seller does not. The only indication I see is that the seller's name is ""Mobiles International LLC"". ""International"", hint hint wink wink. Nothing mentioned in the product description. Either way, the phone was delivered to me with Spanish as the default language but the setup process made it somewhat easy to change that given that I know a few languages, so Spanish / French are easy to understand for me. I was skeptical of other reviews which claimed this was delivered with Spanish as the default language. I can 100% confirm this was the case for me in late September of 2019. I was able to change it, but keep this in mind if you're purchasing this product as something that should be turn key. After that, I had to mess with the timezone settings and my device came set up as Vietnam as the default timezone region.

samsung,"3rd time not the charm.... I bought this phone in November of 2018, the sub-contractor for the original purchase was, MyWit. It arrived in an OEM box, with an OEM charger, well packed, and in perfect condition. The problem was I could not register the phone, it kept asking for the original registration information... I actually spent nearly 2 days trying on a single battery charge. After contacting customer service, I was told if I didnt weant to wait for them to recieve the return, have a replzcement authorized by the sub-contractor, and then get the replacement, I would need to purchase another phone, and they would sent it out, 2 day shipping. This is what I did. The replacement phone came from a sub-contractor named, Quick Deals CD. It arrived in a generic box, with a charger, that wouls not charge this phone. The appearance was fine, no problems I could see. After charging the phone for 5 hours, I registered it, and noticed after a short time the charge level was at 50%. & recharged the phone and left it alone on a table, only turning it on, every hour to check the charge. The phone was losing 10% charge every hour, just sitting. I contacted Customer service to get another replacement, this one come normal shipping. When the third phone arrived it was from Quick Deals CD, again, and again it came in a generic box, without protection, and WITHOUT and charger, working or otherwise. The screen has minor, but visible scratches on it, and the back cover has a very deep gouge in it. The battery was once again junk!

I was told I would be receiving a $25.00 ""promotional certificate"", for my trouble, I thought great that will pay for the battery, but I guess they couldn't get around to it... because i have received nothing, but I still had to pay for the replacement parts, in order to create a working phone.

samsung,"Almost Perfect. Overall the Galaxy S8 is an excellent smartphone that competes and often one ups other current flagship phones (Google Pixel, iPhone). Ultimately a few odd design decisions keep this from achieving a full 5 star review from me. PROS -The best looking screen on any mass market phone ever produced -Excellent camera performance -Lighter version of Touchwiz (Samsung OS) including the ability to disable and uninstall bloatware -Not too big to hold (a bit long though) -Solid battery performance CONS -Odd positioning of a dedicated button for ""Bixby"" Samsung's assistant software. This button is far too close to the volume down button and I hit it constantly by accident. Worse yet, it can't be disabled without downloading a third party app. Even worse, Bixby itself is not anywhere near as useful as Google assistant. Samsung...PLEASE stop messing with software. Leave Google alone, this is their core business competency and your incessant layering on of useless features (now coming with a dedicated button) is obscene. This design flaw will ultimately drive me to a Google Pixel upon their next release (most likely Fall 2017). -Odd positioning of the fingerprint sensor. Way too far up on the phone which makes it hard to reach, right next to the camera lens. Bad design. -Fragile glass. I dropped it from between knee and waist height one time and the glass cracked. If you buy, you must invest in a screen protector. Ultimately if you can deal with the annoyances listed above you should have no reservations buying this phone. The screen itself is worth the investment. Every time I show someone a photo on my camera they comment on how good it looks. Here's to hoping Samsung scratches the Bixby button, embeds the finger print reader in the screen, and offers a pure Android version. That to me would be the perfect phone.",2017-05-18,positive,4,en,almost perfect overall galaxy excellent smartphone competes often one ups current flagship phones google pixel iphone ultimately odd design decisions keep achieving full star review pros best looking screen mass market phone ever produced excellent camera performance lighter version touchwiz samsung os including ability disable uninstall bloatware big hold bit long though solid battery performance cons odd positioning dedicated button bixby samsungs assistant software button far close volume button hit constantly accident worse yet cant disabled without downloading third party app even worse bixby anywhere near useful google assistant samsungplease stop messing software leave google alone core business competency incessant layering useless features coming dedicated button obscene design flaw ultimately drive google pixel upon next release likely fall odd positioning fingerprint sensor way far phone makes hard reach right next camera lens bad design fragile glass dropped knee waist height one time glass cracked buy must invest screen protector ultimately deal annoyances listed reservations buying phone screen worth investment every time show someone photo camera comment good looks heres hoping samsung scratches bixby button embeds finger print reader screen offers pure android version would perfect phone,2,2

samsung,"it's currently the best windows phone on the market. If you are buying this and have Verizon service, it's currently the best windows phone on the market! I used this phone for a little but with a friends sim card and it works flawlessly! If your buying this for another carrier, ICK... Everything works with my T-Mobile service except: Buying Apps Through T-Mobile - have to use a credit card Internet Sharing - Tether-X from the App Store DOES work, but T-Mobile, Samsung, and Verizon are ZERO help at fixing this. Verizon actually sent all the codes to the phone when I had a friends Verizon Sim card in and unlocked everything they could. When I put the T-Mobile Sim card in, it re-locked and asked me to contact Verizon again. Receiving MMS Messages: I can send any message just fine. But after putting in the correct APN settings the MMS messages all come in ""Opps, the message your trying to receive is no longer on the server"" As far as accessories go, the phone is barely supported by Samsung. Even though it is almost the same design as the S4 it's not and none of those cases will fit. So if you HAVE to have a case for your phone, just by a Nokia. DO NOT UPDATE TO WINDOWS 8.1 DEVELOPERS PREVIEW. I didn't believe everyone when they said not to do this. Cortana and other Windows 8.1 features are hard to give up, but don't do it. Issues with Windows 8.1: When someone calls make sure to hit the power off button before talking other wise the touch screen will become unresponsive. Starting Camera App can restart the phone If you can get into the camera app, taking a picture can restart the phone Changing lenses or camera settings could restart the phone The phone has a hard time focusing, which causes a lot of wasted time and blurry photos. Apps will suddenly stop working, requiring a installation to function properly (Super annoying for games) Phone will not always charge when plugged in. Touch screen will stop responding randomly, sometimes the app just needs to be restarted. Others the phone needs to be restarted. Voice commands are often unheard Many of the issues with the phone could be fixed with a firmware/software upgrade from Samsung. A few times I tried to call Samsung for help with my issues most of the employees didn't even know this phone existed. I was told to go to Best Buy and have their tech help out, but the Samsung guy at best buy was pissed. He only works with Android phones and said that the call center KNOWS not to send windows people to the Samsung centers in Best Buy Stores. My Ativ SE was the first he'd seen and he'd never seen the Ativ S ""In over two years of working the Samsung center"" (according to him) All that said, it's still the best windows phone. I've learned to deal with the issues and am not afraid to play around and experiment to get everything working. The LACK of support from Samsung, Customization of the Operating System strait from the factory for Verizon, no decent cases, and having to customize the APN by hand makes this phone a FOR VERIZON CUSTOMERS only option unless your a techie. The phone comes FULLY unlocked, and the LTE does function on T-Mobile. You don't need to D/L the APN for GSM Phones to get it to work on T-Mobile. Go to Settings > cellular + SIM > SIM Settings Turn Manual Internet APN ON edit internet APN: APN - fast.t-mobile.com IP type - IPv4v6 Leave all other fields BLANK and hit save edit MMS APN APN - fast.t-mobile.com MMSC (url) - http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapenc MMSC port - 80 IP type - IPv4v6 Leave all other fields blank. AGAIN I updated this to windows 8.1, I did this as soon as I received the phone. Not sure how many of the issues above are related to updating the Operating system before it's officially available for the Ativ SE but the Nokia Icon was the other option being considered. If you can live with out an SD Card Slot or removable battery, it's probably the best option and second best windows phone available. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWEMZ1E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HWEMZ1E&linkCode=as2&tag=cagespar-20&linkId=CU7WMGSYADPGLMLR"">Nokia Lumia Icon, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)</a><img src=""http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cagespar-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00HWEMZ1E"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" > <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HWENIUG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HWENIUG&linkCode=as2&tag=cagespar-20&linkId=SD4P7UNDU4ENUKQI"">Nokia Lumia Icon, White 32GB (Verizon Wireless)</a><img src=""http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cagespar-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00HWENIUG"" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" alt="""" style=""border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"" >",2014-09-22,positive,4,en,currently best windows phone market buying verizon service currently best windows phone market used phone little friends sim card works flawlessly buying another carrier ick everything works tmobile service except buying apps tmobile use credit card internet sharing tetherx app store work tmobile samsung verizon zero help fixing verizon actually sent codes phone friends verizon sim card unlocked everything could put tmobile sim card relocked asked contact verizon receiving mms messages send message fine putting correct apn settings mms messages come opps message trying receive longer server far accessories go phone barely supported samsung even though almost design none cases fit case phone nokia update windows developers preview didnt believe everyone said cortana windows features hard give dont issues windows someone calls make sure hit power button talking wise touch screen become unresponsive starting camera app restart phone get camera app taking picture restart phone changing lenses camera settings could restart phone phone hard time focusing causes lot wasted time blurry photos apps suddenly stop working requiring installation function properly super annoying games phone always charge plugged touch screen stop responding randomly sometimes app needs restarted others phone needs restarted voice commands often unheard many issues phone could fixed firmwaresoftware upgrade samsung times tried call samsung help issues employees didnt even know phone existed told go best buy tech help samsung guy best buy pissed works android phones said call center knows send windows people samsung centers best buy stores ativ se first hed seen hed never seen ativ two years working samsung center according said still best windows phone ive learned deal issues afraid play around experiment get everything working lack support samsung customization operating system strait factory verizon decent cases customize apn hand makes phone verizon customers option unless techie phone comes fully unlocked lte function tmobile dont need dl apn gsm phones get work tmobile go settings cellular sim sim settings turn manual internet apn edit internet apn apn fasttmobilecom ip type ipvv leave fields blank hit save edit mms apn apn fasttmobilecom mmsc url mmsc port ip type ipvv leave fields blank updated windows soon received phone sure many issues related updating operating system officially available ativ se nokia icon option considered live sd card slot removable battery probably best option second best windows phone available nokia lumia icon black gb verizon wireless nokia lumia icon white gb verizon wireless,2,2

The volume with headphones is about half what it needs to be.

The biggest selling point of the phone is the incredible display, and you're telling me that it isn't wise to use it to it's fullest potential?) A giant failure on the part of Samsung.

samsung,"Durable, Functional Phone with Surprising Features. Though yes, I'm not a Verified Purchaser, I have owned one of these phones in the past; it was my first phone. Phonewise, the Convoy's a phone, it does its job and it's got all the features you'd expect. Quality was clear and good. It's a nine-digit keypad so don't expect to be sending any complex text messages about nuclear physics, and you'll be doing a lot of ""k"" and ""lol"" so let your friends know ahead of time, but if you're used to that kind of typing, it works. FEATURES In the back of the phone, behind the battery is where your sim card is kept. On the sides of the phone you've got plastic buttons for volume, speaker mode, and a big red push-to-talk button that can be reprogrammed for other purposes. You've also got the micro USB port for your charging cable, a port for a micro SD, and a headphone jack, though there's bluetooth if you wanna flex your Airpods on the normies. Music sound fine as well, both over bluetooth, through the jack, and through the surprisingly loud speakers mounted on the face of the phone, but if you watch something off Youtube the audio quality drops drastically, so keep this in mind. Speaking of mobile data and youtube, like most modern phones this phone can surf the web, but don't expect to do it very well. Even sites specifically formatted for mobile users don't work well with this phone so expect all formatting to be off and sites to be zoomed out; luckily the programmers realized this and at least added a zoom feature. Any audio you play, like youtube, any news sites, etc. will sound grainy and off. It's definitely an issue with your data/internet, though, cause otherwise, music downloaded to the phone sounds perfectly fine. The camera's alright too, surprisingly good quality all things considered, though it takes at least a second to autofocus. You can actually take selfies with this thing, the camera is accessible from the front-facing screen when the lid is closed. Let's talk about battery life. Although it's expected that flip phones have longer battery lives, the life on this bad boy is outstanding. One time I went a whole month without charging it, though expect ~1 1/2-2 weeks, maybe more depending on your activity. Of course if you're a wealthy businessman, member of the Payday gang, or anyone else who makes a lot of long calls the battery won't last nearly as long, but regardless know that you're getting a lot of battery time. DURABILITY This phone is, obviously, highly durable and quite ruggedized, being built to military specifications in regards to durability and waterproofing. During high school, this was actually a party trick of mine, I'd take the phone and chuck it across the lunch yard and the thing would be perfectly intact. One time, I accidentally struck the phone with a framing hammer. For those who don't know, this isn't your average hammer, it's heavier and has a larger strike face, but even with all this the phone shrugged it off with just a little scratch. I've dropped it a fair amount into dusty environments as well, one time off a two-story house that was under construction and all that's happened were a few scratches. DRAWBACKS I won't be listing things like the audio quality while surfing, or the poor surfing quality in general, as a con here, mainly because the phone isn't really something to surf the web on. What I will list as a con, though, is its inability to connect to your wifi so if you want to access the internet, it will be through mobile data. Another downside is the design of the charging port. To make the phone ruggedized all the ports are set into the phone and covered with a plastic/rubber cap. Unfortunately, the port is too small to fit a lot of other chargers that would otherwise be compatible, so don't lose the cable that comes with it like I did, and know that if you need to borrow a charger you better hope it works. For students who have teachers really particular about phones, know that the phone starts beeping every so often when it hits low battery. It's not super loud and it stops when you turn it off, but from what I've seen there's no way to mute it. Even when the whole phone is muted the low battery alarm will still sound. Another downside is not all teachers will believe you when you explain it to them, long story, don't ask. Final note, not exactly a downside, but the screens are, of course, plastic and easier to scratch. Not like it matters much, but something to note. OVERALL Despite the small handful of drawbacks the phone is great. Calls sound great, audio's good, surfing isn't half-bad, and it's durable and has survived multiple incidents involving everything from accidental submersion to intentional damage. If you need a no-frills, durable phone just to make calls and send and receive basic texts, this works well. Especially if you work construction or other industrial jobs.",2019-11-18,positive,5,en,durable functional phone surprising features though yes im verified purchaser owned one phones past first phone phonewise convoys phone job got features youd expect quality clear good ninedigit keypad dont expect sending complex text messages nuclear physics youll lot k lol let friends know ahead time youre used kind typing works features back phone behind battery sim card kept sides phone youve got plastic buttons volume speaker mode big red pushtotalk button reprogrammed purposes youve also got micro usb port charging cable port micro sd headphone jack though theres bluetooth wanna flex airpods normies music sound fine well bluetooth jack surprisingly loud speakers mounted face phone watch something youtube audio quality drops drastically keep mind speaking mobile data youtube like modern phones phone surf web dont expect well even sites specifically formatted mobile users dont work well phone expect formatting sites zoomed luckily programmers realized least added zoom feature audio play like youtube news sites etc sound grainy definitely issue datainternet though cause otherwise music downloaded phone sounds perfectly fine cameras alright surprisingly good quality things considered though takes least second autofocus actually take selfies thing camera accessible frontfacing screen lid closed lets talk battery life although expected flip phones longer battery lives life bad boy outstanding one time went whole month without charging though expect weeks maybe depending activity course youre wealthy businessman member payday gang anyone else makes lot long calls battery wont last nearly long regardless know youre getting lot battery time durability phone obviously highly durable quite ruggedized built military specifications regards durability waterproofing high school actually party trick mine id take phone chuck across lunch yard thing would perfectly intact one time accidentally struck phone framing hammer dont know isnt average hammer heavier larger strike face even phone shrugged little scratch ive dropped fair amount dusty environments well one time twostory house construction thats happened scratches drawbacks wont listing things like audio quality surfing poor surfing quality general con mainly phone isnt really something surf web list con though inability connect wifi want access internet mobile data another downside design charging port make phone ruggedized ports set phone covered plasticrubber cap unfortunately port small fit lot chargers would otherwise compatible dont lose cable comes like know need borrow charger better hope works students teachers really particular phones know phone starts beeping every often hits low battery super loud stops turn ive seen theres way mute even whole phone muted low battery alarm still sound another downside teachers believe explain long story dont ask final note exactly downside screens course plastic easier scratch like matters much something note overall despite small handful drawbacks phone great calls sound great audios good surfing isnt halfbad durable survived multiple incidents involving everything accidental submersion intentional damage need nofrills durable phone make calls send receive basic texts works well especially work construction industrial jobs,2,2

samsung,"Amazing Phone. It's the Galaxy S4, you know it's amazing already so why are you reading this, buy it! It's basically an incremental upgrade from the S3. The screen is bigger, but the phone is actually smaller and thinner overall. The build quality is great. High quality plastic is what should be used on a mobile phone to keep it light and so everything bends instead of snaps like on metal or hybrid-ceramic phones. This phone is as light or lighter than the S3, which is great when it sits in your pocket you hardly notice it is there. The screen is absolutely amazing. If the colors are too saturated for you because of the bright AMOLED technology, Samsung has included software to tone down the colors a little or a lot, whatever you want. At 1080p you can view full, regular size webpages and read the smallest text with ease. The battery life is great as well, even at full brightness with heavy screen on time. The included software from Samsung is great, but it does take up some battery life, but you can simply turn it all of to improve battery life if you wish. That is the great thing about this phone and Android.

samsung,"Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5. I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.",2013-01-23,positive,5,en,really impressed phone windows ordered samsung focus unlocked phone price good wanted test windows os carrier consumer cellular nd sim card free plus adding phone account dollars month received card phone day inserted card voila making calls inserted gig microsd card ton memory work setting wireless home network snap using usb connection download updates apps want easy gps google stuff etc download things phone preloaded att proprietary apps att account working apps nicest surprise got windows office preloaded set skydrive home pc phone download edit documents word excel powerpoint whenever like wasnt nice cellular data connection wasnt working first blaming phone unlocked wasnt case call consumer cellular support minutes later using cellular data connection web bottom line going perfectly set box may require working carrier service set great consult cellular carrier youll need imei number itll speed things already get dialing phone writing number use oh need install zune onto pc im particularly impressed big deal use sync music anyway,2,2

Beautiful screen and overall design, a stellar camera, great speed and performance/hardware, expandable memory, waterproof, the S-pen, and on and on it goes.

Also, I personally don't find that charging my phone is an inconvenience, especially with how fast it charges, and considering Samsung's massive debacle with the Note 7's battery, you can understand why they wouldn't gamble on creating a super-battery.

samsung,"GREAT PHONE FOR THE PRICE, EXCEPT FOR THE BATTERY. I received this phone a week ago. It was exactly as advertised in ""like new"" condition. The screen, frame, and back cover are flawless and appear unused. No scratches, no dings, no scuffs. The stylus is genuine Samsung and appears new. The only visual flaw I could find anywhere was a faint rub mark on the home key, and that could easily have happened before or during manufacture of the phone. All features appear to be working correctly. The only quibble I have so far is that the OE Samsung battery that came with the phone is a dud. It seems to fully charge, but the charge runs down a little faster than normal and then drops to 0% immediately after reaching 50% or so. I bought this phone to replace another Galaxy Note 4 I've had for years that overheated, crashed, and refused to power back up (my fault not the phone's). My dead phone had a recent new battery, so I just swapped it out. It's working fine with that known good battery, so I'm pretty sure the battery life issue was the battery and not the new phone. I've seen other complaints about the battery life in these refurbed phones, so if you purchase one I'd expect to have to replace it. This is the last Samsung Galaxy to have a user-replaceable battery (one of the main reasons I wanted to stay with this specific model), and you can find all you want for $10-$15 on Amazon. Depending on the carrier this phone sold for $700-$800 when new. Getting a replacement in like-new condition for $165 seems like a great bargain to me, even if you have to spring for another few dollars for a fresh battery. Bringing the new phone online was a snap. Just pull the SIM card out of the old phone, insert it in the new phone and power it up. As soon as it finished booting up it was immediately recognized by Verizon. I gave the screen 5 stars because it has the appearance of a brand new screen. I gave the battery life 1 star for obvious reasons. I didn't rate the fingerprint scanner, because I don't use that feature (and didn't use it on my old Galaxy Note 4).

samsung,"Decent flip phone, but.... Decent flip phone. Be aware that Samsung chargers are noisy! They make a high pitched noise when charging. This is not isolated to this model or just phones, but many Samsung products. I have read many reviews and blogs about the issue and the best solution is to use a different brand of charger. My other issues with the phone are that the manual is totally lame. It is a very small ""manual"" that covers little more than the physical anatomy and most basic functions. It gives you no real information about the real use and programming. Some programming functions have a Help option which has real information, but many don't and you are on your own to figure out how to program it and why. I was very unhappy with the initial programming (such as the Lock feature and Driving Mode) and it took some work to get the phone working the way that I wanted. The phone does NOT include a holster or case as some reviews led me to believe. Voice commands don't seem to work with anything but contacts and calling numbers. Despite all of the above, it met my expectations and does NOT have some of the flaws that similar phones have. It has not shut off, or lost signal, and the battery life is good. I get a nice 3G and 1xxxx signal. It has a flashlight function that activates the camera flash for several seconds which is nice, if you don't do it when pointed in your face! I wish that there was still a Verizon flipin phone with a QWERTY keyboard like the EN-V-3. I REALLY miss the QWERTY keyboard for texting. It met my expectations and seems to be the best option out there for this type of phone on the Verizon network.

After less than a week of using the phone, it would reset every time I set the phone on a hard surface (counter, desk, coffee table, ect.) While this was frustrating, I got used to being very gentle with the phone and to set it on soft surfaces most of the time. After two months of using the phone, the camera stopped working. Each time I would open the camera application, I would receive a ""The Camera has failed"" message. After multiple troubleshooting attempts, I gave up on the camera. After three months, charging the phone became a problem as it would often fail to charge. It would repeatedly start/stop charging until it ran its battery to 0%. Often I would go to sleep with the phone charging and set my alarm only to wake up late with a dead phone. Extremely frustrating! Finally, in March of 2016, along with tons of software issues, the phone is unable to charge and does not respond to USB. Six months from delivery to DEATH! A complete flop.

First of all, I've bought several phones from Amazon (and Ebay) over the years, and its always been a crapshoot on whether its gonna work or not. I knew this going in this time, which is why I decided to find a BRAND NEW Galaxy S7 and pay the extra cost for a non-refurbished, non-used, non-returned unit. I simply wanted a good phone right out of the box to replace my wife's old Galaxy S5 that's seen better days. It was supposed to be a birthday present for her. Yeah, not gonna happen. Got the phone yesterday morning, opened it up, went to power it on and the phone wouldn't even turn on. Okay, battery must be fully depleted, let's throw it on the charger. After 10 minutes I get it to power up and go through the basic settings to make sure everything works. Got through the setup, all looks well, but battery its at 4% with it plugged in, better turn it back off and let it fully charge. At 7PM, almost 8 hours later, its sitting at 81% charge and will go no further. I leave it charging the rest of the night on the charger and wake up to the yellow triangle screen! Okay, let's start the phone and see if I can throw a battery testing app on there. WTF!!??!?! I can't get it to boot now? I go into factory reset menu, wipe data/factory reset phone, then do a full cache wipe, the reboot, I can now get back into the phone, but its just not acting right, and I know how an S7 works, I have mine sitting right here, working like a champ and able to charge in minutes, not hours. I'm assuming the battery has been sitting way too long without a charge, the phone was either accidentally turned on when it was boxed up, or it turned itself on sometime after its manufacture date.

samsung,"To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because.... X-posted. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization. Like every other device, this one is rife with pre-installed apps. I didn't do a whole lot of poking around to see if they could all be disabled, but every useless bit of bloatware I wanted gone -- NFL Mobile, all verizon apps except MyVerizon, Milk, Slacker, Facebook, etc. -- was easily disabled. NFC is better implemented than in the S5 resulting in less shifting about to find a ""sweet spot"" so I can more easily use Google Wallet. No problems with BT as there were in the S5, specifically a problem I had with using BT devices such as my fitbit that caused WiFi to go on the fritz while BT was active. IR transmitter is superb & the included Peel Smart Remote app took less than a minutes to configure for both my television & DirecTV box & I haven't needed to reach for a remote since. I'm not a camera junkie & I seldom take pictures of anything other than my dog being an idiot, but I have to admit that the pictures look pretty amazing. Given my limited experience, the editing tools where pretty intuitive but tbh, I only cropped a few Pics. Aside from the screen & performance & wireless charging another real improvement is in the audio when compared to my previous devices. Mind you, just as I'm not a camera junkie, I'm also not an audiophile. Like my previous handsets this has a single speaker, but unlike those it is set in the bottom edge of the phone rather than the back. I used to have to turn the volume to max & cup my hand around the back of my S5 to get decent audio but whether the S6's speaker is so significantly improved or its placement is better or a combination of the two, this thing is LOUD! I usually turn on an audio book to fall asleep to & actually had to turn this down to 50% because it was disturbing my sleep. I do occasionally cover the speaker when holding the device in landscape mode, but that's just because I haven't become fully acclimated to the device. Finally, the form-factor -- that I adore -- will require quite the adjustment from what we've all learned to be standard. It's really an excellent lesson in how uninnovative handset manufacturers have been in re-imagining both the means of delivering content & our interaction with that content -- the screen. When I reach into my pocket I want to grab the rounded bit so I can look at the flat side, because that's the screen, right? The Edge changes that paradigm, perhaps not drastically, but it changes it nonetheless. In my pre-purchase review reading some evaluators considered this an ""ergonomic problem"", some felt that their fingers hit the edge; I've found neither to be a problem. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad & with consistent use I've found my fingers fit quite comfortably on the aluminum surround without messing with the screen. Form-wise, it is instantly recognizable as a S-Series phone, but this iteration is a superb high-end rendering of that aesthetic. Although I run the risk of overstating how visually appealing this device is, I am willing to label it an objet d'art. One that I was almost afraid to use due to its apparent fragility until a few accidental drops on tile confirmed that it is as durable as it is beautiful as it is functional.

samsung,"Too many problems to be new!!. I loved my S7 until the LCD screen blew up, so I got on Amazon to look for another new S7. Ordered a ""new"" phone on 2/16/19. Didn't want a reconditioned phone. New phone arrived next day. I had Best Buy upload everything as I watched. Then the problems began... First, the touch screen began doubling up on the letters Z, M & N. Then the phone would open multiple apps without my input (was it possessed maybe?). Then the piece de resistance -- THE VOLUME KEYS STOPPED WORKING!!!!!! Phone was only 2 months old!!! I was in LA on family business, being driven nuts by the loud ringtones that I couldn't lower without going to the Sounds setting to adjust, then I couldn't hear the ringer! Went to Samsung website to register phone & was unable to, as they said the phone was outside of warranty effective 12/18/18. Still trying to get something working, I scheduled a visit to the Samsung service center for repair. I arrived there this morning, only to be told the phone's IMEI has no warranty period left. So, what the seller listed as true is apparently not, and I'm out a chunk of change. Expensive lesson, given our fixed income & the fact I had to purchase a different phone (S10e) from Best Buy that will be more reliable. And it has a REAL WARRANTY!! So, save yourself some heartache & don't purchased ""new"" phones from the seller Vitalli or Amazon. They will not be new or under warranty.

samsung,"I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed. All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently. First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why. Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later. Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping. Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition. Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet. Now the actual review: Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in. There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational. Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry. I absolutely love this feature and it is very important. Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps. The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones. Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage. UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy. Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart. People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities. (I will update more here) The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well. The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way. NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing. I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications. Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere. Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering. More to come. UPDATE 12.13.13 I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now. Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away. I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that. ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it. Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side). So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges. Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality. Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!",2013-10-14,positive,5,en,really reluctant purchase samsung device changed right honest review note something

samsung,"A really satisfying new phone - far better than its entry level price.. I was on an iPhone 6, until it stopped working; the IC needed to be replaced, which would've been $100. So I started shopping for a new/current phone, and after a bunch of research, landed on this J3. It's basically the same size as the iPhone 6 (a tiny bit physically bigger, with a larger viewable area), and it's super solid. Now, it's not a $500 iPhone (or a $750 XR or an $1100 XPlus...) so it's got some limitations. The camera isn't as good, and I don't think the processor is AS fast. I haven't noticed any issues in any real important apps, but, while I don't play a lot of super modern games, Clash of Clans can get a tiny bit jittery in busy moments. When I think about the first phone I got for the same amount of money in 1997 (the Nokia 101 I think...) it's amazing that I can get this much technology for a price that's this reasonable. I have only had it two days; if it starts to tank, I'll re-review. But, overall, it's been a really solid transition.

samsung,"Some Advantages to this phone you might not have considered.. Three things you might not have considered about this phone: Admittedly, I'm an atypical cell phone user. I don't actually make or receive a lot of calls--probably because I was a very late adopter of the technology. I was finally forced into buying one for a job that required it. Nonetheless, I've been very happy with this phone. Here are three great things about it you might not have considered: 1) It sounds fantastic. I'm not referring to the quality of the microphone or speakers (although they are pretty good) for phonecalls but the amplifier used for playing .mp3 and .mp4 files. With a good set of headphones, music on this phone sounds great! Far better than it did on the iPod touch I was using before I bought this phone. If you're an audiophile and rely your phone for portable music, this is a great choice. Also, the easily replaceable SD memory card means that you have the memory capacity to rip lots of songs at the highest bit rates. 2) It seems almost waterproof. Twice, I've accidentally immersed this phone completely in fresh water. After opening it up, removing the battery and all the cards as well as the S pen, and drying it out, it still works perfectly. Not that I'd recommend dunking your phone any longer than you have to. Maybe I've just been lucky. 3) The battery (easily replaceable) has long life and charges incredibly quickly. Anyway, some bonuses to buying this phone in addition to the beautiful, big display and the stylus--two of the main reasons that I purchased it.",2015-09-06,positive,5,en,advantages phone might considered three things might considered phone admittedly im atypical cell phone user dont actually make receive lot callsprobably late adopter technology finally forced buying one job required nonetheless ive happy phone three great things might considered sounds fantastic im referring quality microphone speakers although pretty good phonecalls amplifier used playing mp mp files good set headphones music phone sounds great far better ipod touch using bought phone youre audiophile rely phone portable music great choice also easily replaceable sd memory card means memory capacity rip lots songs highest bit rates seems almost waterproof twice ive accidentally immersed phone completely fresh water opening removing battery cards well pen drying still works perfectly id recommend dunking phone longer maybe ive lucky battery easily replaceable long life charges incredibly quickly anyway bonuses buying phone addition beautiful big display stylustwo main reasons purchased,2,2

It is a nice phone for the price but be advised the default language of the phone is Spanish. Even the quick start guide is Spanish language only. It does come with Amazon tech support and I called and luckily I got a tech who understood Spanish. He helped me through the boot up process (all in Spanish) and got me to the settings function where we were finally able to set the default language to USA English. Once that was done the only other issue I found was that the keyboard defaulted to USA Spanish. They are english letters but spanish accent marks over some of the letters. This caused a issue with entering our wi-fi information as in spanish the n has a tlide accent mark. All that being said it is a nice phone. In my opinion well worth the money and even with the issue of converting the language to USA english.

samsung,"DO NOT BUY IT! Defective and old phone. This is a scam. Do not buy it. This is a defective product, which will show vertical pink lines in the screen after a few months of usage. In addition, it is old although it is described as new. All seemed good for the first months, but then some pink lines started appearing on the screen (see picture). I never dropped the phone or damaged it in any way, the pink lines appeared out of nowhere. After googling the problem, I found out that is a common problem for a defective lot of this phone, so it seems Amazon is scamming people selling this defective lot. You would think: ""No problem! Samsung gives a 1 year manufacturer's warranty!"". There comes the second scam: although Amazon is selling this product as new, according to Samsung, it was sold for the first time in 2016 (they find that after searching the phone IMEI number), so the Samsung 1 year warranty is expired. In other words, Amazon will not let you return it, and it is not covered by Samsung warranty anymore. The worse part: Amazon will not let you return the phone after you see the defect. In my case, it took 4 months for the defect to show, and Amazon only allows you to return stuff up to 3 months after the purchase. Even if it is clearly a manufacturing defect and it is proven that they sold an old phone advertising it as new. Amazon just do not care. They will blame the seller and tell you there is nothing they can do if their sellers are criminals. The worst part: Amazon Customer Service is the worst I have ever seen. Each time you call they tell you must wait for a week and they will call you back, but they never do. Some of Amazon Customer Service representatives assured me I would be refunded, but I was never refunded, and after I called again, they would just tell me that the person who talked to me before did not know what he was saying and that they should train better their representatives...

samsung,"Defective phone. Firstly, I love this phone and I was purchasing this to replace my existing s6 active which had the charging port fail (thankfully it has wireless charging for now). Please listen to the other reviews here, there is something wrong with the phones they are selling. The phone initially turned on fine and charged and let me go through the setup, however after trying to install the software update it froze halfway through before going black. It was then unresponsive for a few minutes before displaying a graphically 'broken' version of the update screen in the middle of the screen with black all around. After this it eventually restarted with a black screen, holding the power button for an extended period did not restart the phone like it should so I had to navigate the touchscreen blindly to restart it (fortunately I have another of the same phone that has a functioning screen so I was able to use it as a reference.) After it finally restarted with display on it was 'unable to find updates' and claimed it was on the newest software version though it was clearly not. I restarted into bootloader mode and cleared the cache and factory reset the device before selecting to reboot the device. After this restart the touch screen seems to be unresponsive and I can no longer restart the device, so it's effectively bricked on delivery.

It CAN: o Have an UNLIMITED amount of Email Accounts including military accounts. o Shoot HI DEF Video with great compression due to being a Microsoft WINDOWS 7 Operating System. o Can shoot thousands of photos before the 8GB of space fills up! o Works great with any Windows product because the same dudes designed it o Can take a beating. I've dropped mine several times, and nothing happened to it. NOTHING! o easy to work on. I've modified a few things on mine and it was SUPER easy to take apart with a video from YouTube.com o Open OFFICE Documents, and .PDFs easily without any fancy anything. o HAS N-WIFI, need I say anything else? o has the FULL version of IE 9.0.xxx internet browser, so you can go to any website! o lots of applications for sale and for free. Not as many as DROID or iPhone but catching up o High Def Screen built at the Factories in S.Korea. SAMSUNG makes most of the internal parts for Apple, Nokia, Sony, etc.. o Easy to use. So fricken easy to use! o Low Cost Smart Phone Option - Dude, got mine with an upgrade at AT&T and it cost $49.99. WOW! The iPhone was $299.99 at the time. o it can mow your lawn...OK it can't mow the lawn! But it can turn the lights, alarm system, and my car on from my bed! o SKYPE, yep, video call for free with a wifi connection. o it's 3G system, which is still fast enough to STREAM video from YouTube or wherever! o has great reception, unlike the other guys ;-) o it's light, black, and SEXY as heck :-) What it can't do: o Cook o Clean o Make Babies o wash your car o take out the trash o brush your teeth --- The only issue I have with this phone, which is minute, is the 1800mah battery.

samsung,"stay away from galaxy note 3. So, I got this phone using ""Verizon Edge"" program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it. I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on ""Automatic"") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds. Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this. So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time...

samsung,... phone for almost a month now and I am happy to say that I am completely satisfied with it. I've had my new phone for almost a month now and I am happy to say that I am completely satisfied with it. It arrived on time and with a new charger just like any other new phone would have. The only thing is that it didn't come with any instructions saying that u had to have a special tool to open the Sims card access point but we were going to at&t anyway so they gave me a new Sims card for free and changes it out for me.

I really appreciate their quick and no nonsense response. Note, there is a 72 hour wait for missing items. Either way no real problems with the phone. 5 out of 5 star performance. The only hangup is swapping from secure and normal mode. The system have crashed three times early on and seems stable now. This may prove to be a real deal breaker if it continues. Hoping it won't because this is simply the best phone Samsung had made in my opinion. And for either secure or enterprise purposes it is exceptional and the best available. The current S-pen outshines all the previous pens. Not many new features compared to note7's pen but it feels smoother and more responsive imo. 5 stars for a 5-star product.

samsung,"Big upgrade, so far a big fan. I just upgraded from the original HTC Evo to the Galaxy 4S. I did love my Evo, but oh my what an improvement! So far (6/5/13) I have only had it one day, but I'll update as I continue to use it. Purchase and shipping: At $149.99 this was the cheapest place for the S4, beating Best Buy and Sprint.com by $100. The phone arrived exactly when it was estimated to. Not a bump or bend on the phone's box, which tells me it was protected perfectly. Hint: no, you are not purchasing a new contract when you check out. It told me that the phone comes with a $110/month contract, but Amazon doesn't actually sell you a contract. You're simply obligated to open one with Sprint. So for upgraders, don't fret, you're not going to be charged an additional $110 for this purchase. Out of the box: This phone is incredibly slim and lightweight. I'm constantly worried I'm going to drop it! The black is this beautiful, sophisticated metallic pattern, the edges banded in brushed aluminum, and the face (what isn't the screen) is a similar brushed aluminum pattern overlayed with a dot grid. All of this texture/patterning is quite subtle but adds a beautiful effect of quality. Yes, I know the back is plastic. But unless you're going to be tapping on it all the time, it feels 100% solid and except for not having the chilled feel of real metal, you'd never know it's plastic. There's no clicking corners, no gaps in the body. no sharp edges to catch stuff on. All of the physical buttons (power, volume and home) are very low profile, but easily accessible. Overall it is a very sleek and professional-looking phone. I couldn't tell you how long exactly that it took to charge the first time. I left the house after about an hour and a half, but when I came back it was fully charged after three hours on the charger. It's easy to activate - just go to sprint.com/activate and you'll chat with a representative. FYI to those who are on family plans but are not the account holder: you will need either the account holder's PIN or the answer to their security question. I'm not sure what happened, but mine did not activate the first time, the rep had me do some sort of reset, and it worked the second time. YOU WILL NEED ACCESS TO WIFI. I don't know why, but it would not let me skip a set up with the home wifi network. So make sure you have the network password in hand to complete initial setup. If you set it up with an existing Gmail account, make sure to log in and turn OFF 2-step verification if you have it enabled. Either that or print out the provided PINs, or have access to the specified back-up phone. Otherwise it will block you from proceeding further, until you verify the phone. First day: As with all phones, there is a lot of bloatware. I went through the App Manager and deleted everything I could, then opened Apps > menu button > Hide applications to remove the rest of them. For example, I use the Gmail app and not the Email app, so I hid the latter. Same with Chrome and IE. The apps aren't deleted, so if later you decide, say, you really do want to use the S Health app, just go to Apps > menu button > Show hidden applications to put it back in the main app menu. To get the ""Life Companion"" message off the lock screen, go to Settings > Lock screen widgets > clock or personal message, and edit as you want. Most of the personalization and adjustment is pretty intuitive. Hold your finger down to move the widget, or on a picture to crop or delete. For those who want a little more control, you can open the Developer Options by going to settings > more > About device and tapping 7 times on Build number. Honestly, though, there's not much there the average user would want to mess with. The phone fits in my pocket pretty easily. Now, I'm a girl, and it's saying something when a phone can fit in girls' jeans pockets. But I wear plain ol' bootcut, so for you girls who wear the low-rise or hip-hugger jeans with teeny tiny pockets, I can promise that this phone won't fit. I've been messing with this phone since about 7pm yesterday. Even after being on a lot, playing games, and general first-day fidgeting with it, the battery is only down to 28% now that it's 4pm. That's fairly impressive, especially since it's been kicking on and off roaming in my concrete box of a building that I work in. Note, though, that I do turn off 3G/4G, wifi, bluetooth, NFC, etc. out of habit when I get to work, since it's just useless. And I must say, having the shortcut buttons placed already in the drop-down notifications menu is quite convenient! (Settings > my device > display > notification panel) Update 6/21/13: I am still in LOVE with this phone. The screen is beautiful, the body is beautiful, it responds wonderfully to touch, and it does everything I ask it to in the blink of an eye. I did end up turning off Air Gestures. There's not much use for it other than when in the browser or gallery, and I just found it a little clunky. You have to do specific gestures over a sensor at the top. The only one I really liked anyways was that you could swipe your palm over the phone while it's off, and the screen would show the time and any notifications. Likewise, Smart Screen is off as well... mostly because I just don't want that sensor eating battery all the time. Update 10/17/13: Yup, I STILL love this phone. I can actually make it 2 or 3 days between charges - remember, though, that I turn off my data connections for half of the day (and considering how easy it is to turn them off and on, I would suggest anyone looking to stretch battery life consider doing that too.) Now that my state has banned phone use in vehicles - period - I'm playing with the Driving Mode and S Voice. Yes, you can just click a button, and your phone will become voice activated while you're driving. I wonder how that does when connected to a car via Bluetooth (unfortunately my car does not have Bluetooth :( so sad.) I have anÂ OtterBox 77-27604 Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - 1 Pack - Carrier Packaging - BlackÂ on my phone. It's quite nice, and fits perfectly. I've already dropped the phone a dozen times on concrete and wood floors, both in the Otterbox and in cheaper cases (once flat on the face with no case, on tile), and it has not one scratch or crack. I'm probably just lucky, but it is a testament to the phone that it's not had an issue with the (accidental) rough handling. I'm a tiny bit annoyed that the Home button seems to catch a bit. You know when you click a button and it makes a ""harder"" click than usual, like the mechanism inside is not so smooth? That's what it's doing. Not by much, but noticeable. That is my only annoyance; however, it doesn't affect the functionality or response of the button, and it hasn't seem to have gotten worse in the 2 months since I noticed it, so it's not really important.",2013-06-05,positive,5,en,big upgrade far big fan upgraded original htc evo galaxy love evo oh improvement far one day ill update continue use purchase shipping cheapest place beating best buy sprintcom phone arrived exactly estimated bump bend phones box tells protected perfectly hint purchasing new contract check told phone comes month contract amazon doesnt actually sell contract youre simply obligated open one sprint upgraders dont fret youre going charged additional purchase box phone incredibly slim lightweight im constantly worried im going drop black beautiful sophisticated metallic pattern edges banded brushed aluminum face isnt screen similar brushed aluminum pattern overlayed dot grid texturepatterning quite subtle adds beautiful effect quality yes know back plastic unless youre going tapping time feels solid except chilled feel real metal youd never know plastic theres clicking corners gaps body sharp edges catch stuff physical buttons power volume home low profile easily accessible overall sleek professionallooking phone couldnt tell long exactly took charge first time left house hour half came back fully charged three hours charger easy activate go sprintcomactivate youll chat representative fyi family plans account holder need either account holders pin answer security question im sure happened mine activate first time rep sort reset worked second time need access wifi dont know would let skip set home wifi network make sure network password hand complete initial setup set existing gmail account make sure log turn step verification enabled either print provided pins access specified backup phone otherwise block proceeding verify phone first day phones lot bloatware went app manager deleted everything could opened apps menu button hide applications remove rest example use gmail app email app hid latter chrome ie apps arent deleted later decide say really want use health app go apps menu button show hidden applications put back main app menu get life companion message lock screen go settings lock screen widgets clock personal message edit want personalization adjustment pretty intuitive hold finger move widget picture crop delete want little control open developer options going settings device tapping times build number honestly though theres much average user would want mess phone fits pocket pretty easily im girl saying something phone fit girls jeans pockets wear plain ol bootcut girls wear lowrise hiphugger jeans teeny tiny pockets promise phone wont fit ive messing phone since pm yesterday even lot playing games general firstday fidgeting battery pm thats fairly impressive especially since kicking roaming concrete box building work note though turn gg wifi bluetooth nfc etc habit get work since useless must say shortcut buttons placed already dropdown notifications menu quite convenient settings device display notification panel update still love phone screen beautiful body beautiful responds wonderfully touch everything ask blink eye end turning air gestures theres much use browser gallery found little clunky specific gestures sensor top one really liked anyways could swipe palm phone screen would show time notifications likewise smart screen well mostly dont want sensor eating battery time update yup still love phone actually make days charges remember though turn data connections half day considering easy turn would suggest anyone looking stretch battery life consider state banned phone use vehicles period im playing driving mode voice yes click button phone become voice activated youre driving wonder connected car via bluetooth unfortunately car bluetooth sad ana otterbox commuter series case samsung galaxy pack carrier packaging blacka phone quite nice fits perfectly ive already dropped phone dozen times concrete wood floors otterbox cheaper cases flat face case tile one scratch crack im probably lucky testament phone issue accidental rough handling im tiny bit annoyed home button seems catch bit know click button makes harder click usual like mechanism inside smooth thats much noticeable annoyance however doesnt affect functionality response button hasnt seem gotten worse months since noticed really important,2,2

samsung,"Awful, awkward, overpriced, yet another Samsung failure.. Awful, awkward, weak battery My battery started out OK but within a few months it has weakened to the point that if I simply put it down and don't use it, it will run out in a few hours. The buttons on the side make it so you can't pick the phone up with activating something which means I am constantly having to close screens I don't want or to reload the screens that I do. A foolish design for an ""active"" phone. The lousy rocker volume bar accidentally adjusts the volume all the time which means that I can never be sure that the volume remains off. That is a problem as I cannot have my phone go off while I am at work. To adjust the media volume, you have to open a program that uses that. Every phone should have a simple volume mute switch on the side. One annoying gimmick is the useless ""Activity Zone"" which has a dedicated button which I have been unable to deactivate. When I hold my phone to speak into the microphone, my thumb naturally lands on this button which then takes over the screen giving my useless data such as my compass heading. Loaded with junk applications some of which, such as ""Samsung Pay"" can't be removed. Because of AT&t, I have been stuck with Samsung for my last 3 phones. Those phones have (1) had the battery weaken before exploding which scorched my electrical outlet and threw a house circuit breaker, (2) had a screen die for no apparent reason, and .(3) been this junk.

samsung,"Seems new and unused, works perfectly, fingerprint reader is not so great.. I just received the phone a couple days ago and now that I've spent some time getting it set-up I can say that this purchase was very well worth it. I was worried that I'd be sent a refurbished phone even though the ad says its factory unlocked but from what I can tell they didn't mislead me, it looks to be in fact an unused phone. It works perfectly (minus the fingerprint reader that's a little iffy, but that's just a model thing) and I had no problems putting in my Rogers SIM card and getting the phone to work. It's a bit sad that there's no warranty on this phone and so I got some form of device protection on my phone plan to make up for it but since I paid a couple hundred less on this phone than if I'd bought it from my service provider or from Samsung I think it's worth it overall. Just gotta make sure to keep the phone in its case and be careful with it. I must say though, this phone is huge. Maybe it's just because I'm not used to large phones but this thing is much larger than I anticipated.

samsung,"Dream phone. This is my 1st new phone since 2012 when I traded in my iPhone for the Note II. My Note II still works great and there hasn't been a compelling reason to upgrade until now. Here are the main reasons I took the step up: 1. Camera. Simply amazing. It takes low-light photos better than you can see with your eye. I took a picture of a childrens play from 25 feet away. It got a full large stage in the picture with about 60 kids - each a small mark in the picture. This was in poor lighting too. I was able to blow up my kid's image to be a full picture and it still looked great. I was doing a little test against my friend's new iPhone 6s in a dimly lit bar. The S7 Edge took a picture of the bar and we were able to blow it up and read the bottle lables. With our eyes, the labels were just blurry dark patches. The iPhone picture was nowhere near this - granular dark unreadable in the same spot. 2. Gear VR. I thought this was a hokey toy but it came with the camera so I tried it. Incredible. The best electronic toy I've ever seen. Walk through Paris, Pyramids, emersive games, see your existing videos in a VR theater. 3. Size. Crazy but they got the giant 5.5"" screen in such a tiny phone. Same form factor as the S6 Edge but much better than that phone otherwise. Fits great in your pocket - just slides right in with no bulge. Loved my Note II but same screen size and it definitely projected in my pocket. Only issue is holding the phone. It can be a little slithery with the thin edges and if you're touching the screen with the hand your holding it with this can mess up touching the screen with the other hand. Recommend getting a tight fitting case that has good gripping edges to solve this. I got a clear one for $8 on Amazon - didn't add to the phone size and the since it's clear I still see the gorgeous phone. There's all the other stuff too but I consider them more incrementally better: much faster processor & memory, crazy great super-hires screen, latest Android OS, etc. Also, my Note II had this so I didn't count it but it was a factor that kept me off of other phones: great to have expandable memory storage. For very little extra get a 64 or 128GB storage and stick it in. Also, a huge plus I'm just getting to appreciate is this is waterproof. I do some watersports and fishing and it's great to have my phone with me when I'm doing them.",2016-03-17,positive,5,en,dream phone st new phone since traded iphone note ii note ii still works great hasnt compelling reason upgrade main reasons took step camera simply amazing takes lowlight photos better see eye took picture childrens play feet away got full large stage picture kids small mark picture poor lighting able blow kids image full picture still looked great little test friends new iphone dimly lit bar edge took picture bar able blow read bottle lables eyes labels blurry dark patches iphone picture nowhere near granular dark unreadable spot gear vr thought hokey toy came camera tried incredible best electronic toy ive ever seen walk paris pyramids emersive games see existing videos vr theater size crazy got giant screen tiny phone form factor edge much better phone otherwise fits great pocket slides right bulge loved note ii screen size definitely projected pocket issue holding phone little slithery thin edges youre touching screen hand holding mess touching screen hand recommend getting tight fitting case good gripping edges solve got clear one amazon didnt add phone size since clear still see gorgeous phone theres stuff consider incrementally better much faster processor memory crazy great superhires screen latest android os etc also note ii didnt count factor kept phones great expandable memory storage little extra get gb storage stick also huge plus im getting appreciate waterproof watersports fishing great phone im,2,2

samsung,"Nothing more, nothing less than OKAY.. I got this phone for my year abroad in Spain. I'm about 2 weeks in, and the phone's battery life is probably the main problem. I'll leave with it fully charged, and within a half hour of being out, it'll drop to about 92% - even if I'm not using the phone. It almost seems like it drops on an exponential curve, and not the favorable kind for battery life. Getting it to charge is another frustration in and of itself. Sometimes the cord works, sometimes it doesn't. It's not a normal micro-USB cord, so I can't even use a cheap replacement to test it out. Sometimes the phone will only charge if I have it sitting juuuuuussssstttt right, or if i'm physically suspending the cord in a position that somehow speaks to the phone. Like I said: frustrating. Aside from battery life, the phone lags. A lot. It seems like I can't really have more than one app open at a time if I want anything to work properly. I guess the S5 has a slightly older computer, because I never had these problems when I used an S6. Anyway, the lag is particularly frustrating when I'm trying to figure out directions in a foreign country, so the phone really isn't doing a great job for the one reason I purchased it. The camera lags a lot as well. Sometimes, the lag ruins the photo if I move the phone even 1 second after I've pressed the capture button. But, I got a DSLR for taking photos, so I'm not too bummed about this. However, it worked with the SIM card with no issues whatsoever. When I have one application open, am near a charger and outlet, and have time on my hands, the phone works great! Otherwise, it's purely OK. This is not the phone for someone who wants instant gratification. This is the phone for a patient person who probably didn't mind dial-up internet too much.",2016-08-31,neutral,3,en,nothing nothing less okay got phone year abroad spain im weeks phones battery life probably main problem ill leave fully charged within half hour itll drop even im using phone almost seems like drops exponential curve favorable kind battery life getting charge another frustration sometimes cord works sometimes doesnt normal microusb cord cant even use cheap replacement test sometimes phone charge sitting juuuuuussssstttt right im physically suspending cord position somehow speaks phone like said frustrating aside battery life phone lags lot seems like cant really one app open time want anything work properly guess slightly older computer never problems used anyway lag particularly frustrating im trying figure directions foreign country phone really isnt great job one reason purchased camera lags lot well sometimes lag ruins photo move phone even second ive pressed capture button got dslr taking photos im bummed however worked sim card issues whatsoever one application open near charger outlet time hands phone works great otherwise purely ok phone someone wants instant gratification phone patient person probably didnt mind dialup internet much,1,0

samsung,"The Truth About the Galaxy Note 8. . Don't believe everything you read on here about the Note 8. Not only does this phone have a beautiful design, it also has a powerful processor and loads of convenient features for everyday use. My only gripe about this phone (aside from its price tag) is the location of the fingerprint sensor which I personally don't really need to use it since you can also use a pin, password, pattern, face recognition or the iris scanner. You have options! As for the battery; you DO NOT have to charge it twice a day like another reviewer mentioned in one of the reviews. I charge my Note 8 in the morning if it needs it. It takes less than 1 1/2 hours to fully charge thanks to the quick charge technology. Once the phone is fully charged, I open power saving mode from the notifications panel and I select MID power saving mode to prolong the battery life and, just in case you're wondering NO it does not affect the phones performance at all. This phone is equipped with 6 GB of RAM so you have the ability to run multiple apps at once with or without the power saving mode feature turned on. This phone is a beast at multitasking and obviously like any other phone it will use up battery life when using all of its resources for a long period of time. For those of you who are really curious about this phone, check out YouTube videos by SuperSaf TV, Android Authority, Sakitech and many others who have posted detailed reviews about this phone. The dual camera with dual OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) takes amazing photos in low light and has so many cool filters and, also comes with its own photo editor pro. You can crop someone out of a photo and place them in another (that's if you're into that kind of stuff). It's the best camera on the Android and possibly even Apple market. At first I was a little annoyed with the Bixby key (Not Bixby) just the key. You can now disable the key which opens Bixby home. Bixby home is just a portal that shows you what's trending on your YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter feed and, also shows you the current weather forecast' which you can conveniently choose to pin or hide from your Bixby portal. It's not as bad as people say it is. Bixby however' is pretty cool. Bixby is not just an average virtual assistant. Bixby does a ton of things like takes screenshots, creates new contacts, opens any specific Pandora station, opens Google maps and navigates to any address you ask for, gets you an Uber and many other things. One of my favorite Bixby features is the ability to create Bixby commands. For example' you can command Bixby to turn on the blue light filter, do not disturb mode and, always on display just by saying ""goodnight""!

samsung,"CAUTION: No Wi-Fi Calling on Verizon. Pretty Nice Phone Otherwise. This factory unlocked Note 8 will not allow you to enable the entire ""Advanced Calling' subset of functions if you are a Verizon user. This means no Wifi calling, a complete deal-breaker for me. Hours wasted with Samsung Tech Support *who ultimately hung up on me during a 'transfer'* and multiple Verizon CSRs, got bounced from one to the other saying, ""Not us, you've got to go through them."" Thankfully Amazon customer support actually understood my grievance with this phone that is advertised to work with any carrier in the US. It technically partially works; LTE, CDMA, 802.11AC all fine, just no firmware support for advanced calling features (though oddly, VoLTE did function). The phablet itself is well made, and the display looks good when looking directly at it. The display otherwise has a terrible blue-shift when looking at even 10Âº off angle in any axis. I was very surprised to discover this after reading so many positive, professional review sites exclaiming the virtues of the Super AMOLED display. It's also a little stuttery, as if the GPU can't draw over 60FPS when scrolling in Chrome. Those downsides mentioned, the display looks incredible under the right circumstances being perpendicular to your view plane, and not skewed off axis laterally at all. The camera is also stupid nice. I didn't have time to enjoy the S-Pen due to hours wasted today in trying to get basic, 4YO calling functionality working on this $1k device. That mentioned, I think that I will try buying it directly through Verizon since I'm sick of iOS. Cheers, and I hope that Amazon CS updates the advertising on this page to reflect this glaring omission of an otherwise good product. Experience: -1 stars (negative stars...)

samsung,"Minor flaws, but awesome overall. Bought this phone to upgrade from my old school Gravity T phone of 3 years and I certainly do not regret it. I have Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 and an ASUS TF300 tablet, so the learning curve for this was non-existent for me (which was the contrary for my mother, who upgraded to an HTC One, disliked it and the size and switched to an iPhone *sadface*). The Good: Large Screen - Nice large screen to do whatever you want Sheer Speed - A quad core processor in a phone SD Card - I bought this to replace both my phone and Mp3 player. This phone does the trick with a 64GB optional SD card. I currently have a 32GB in there filled with music. The Neutral: TouchWiz - Most of the additional features that the galaxy offers, like NFC (data exchange for touching devices), S-Beam, Air Gesture, etc I find as gimmicks and are attempted selling points that I never use. The UI is also familiar to most, but I did what I do with any Android deveice: Install Nova Launcher over it. The Bad: Battery Life (initially) - The first two days I owned the phone, I was unhappy with the battery life. I would unplug it from the charger at 7:00 AM before I head to work, and by the time I am done with work at 4:00 PM, it would be down to around 35-40%. I found that Google Services was taking up a lot of battery. I had to do some digging to fix this, but I disabled all google account syncing except for Contacts and Calendar, since the constant syncing can wake up the device to perform its tasks. I also disabled Google Maps from automatically updating its location and disabled Google Now. I also set my email to update less frequently (from 5 minutes (lol) to 30 minutes) and set it to store less emails, thus reducing the time the email app must have a ""wakelock"" to do its business. In short, it was a few headaches to get the battery life to a satisfactory level for me. Storage Space - 16Gb, of which roughly half of it was taken for Samsung's implementation of Android and TouchWiz. Slightly annoying...almost as bad as Microsoft taking up half of 64GB for their implementation of Windows 8 Touch. Overall, I love the S4 and am glad I upgraded. When I got my S4, my mom upgraded to an HTC One, so I had time to compare the two juggernauts of the Android market and I can honestly say, though both have their pros and cons, I love my S4 (All the HTC has going for it are the good camera in dark conditions and the dual audio speakers).",2013-05-30,positive,4,en,minor flaws awesome overall bought phone upgrade old school gravity phone years certainly regret samsung galaxy player asus tf tablet learning curve nonexistent contrary mother upgraded htc one disliked size switched iphone sadface good large screen nice large screen whatever want sheer speed quad core processor phone sd card bought replace phone mp player phone trick gb optional sd card currently gb filled music neutral touchwiz additional features galaxy offers like nfc data exchange touching devices sbeam air gesture etc find gimmicks attempted selling points never use ui also familiar android deveice install nova launcher bad battery life initially first two days owned phone unhappy battery life would unplug charger head work time done work pm would around found google services taking lot battery digging fix disabled google account syncing except contacts calendar since constant syncing wake device perform tasks also disabled google maps automatically updating location disabled google also set email update less frequently minutes lol minutes set store less emails thus reducing time email app must wakelock business short headaches get battery life satisfactory level storage space gb roughly half taken samsungs implementation android touchwiz slightly annoyingalmost bad microsoft taking half gb implementation windows touch overall love glad upgraded got mom upgraded htc one time compare two juggernauts android market honestly say though pros cons love htc going good camera dark conditions dual audio speakers,2,2

samsung,"Take your business to a different company. Save your money and never buy from this sham of a company. I purchased this phone after doing extensive research on what kind of phone I wanted, and this one fit the bill best, so I was excitedly waiting for it to arrive. Activating it on my network wasn't a problem, but I had nothing but problems from then on. For starters, the battery must have been bad because the battery died at a rate of 20-25% per hour during normal use texting and browsing Pinterest. There was a hardware defect in the camera causing permanent blue confetti-like lines in all my photos. When the phone was on the home screen, it would at least once a day vibrate harshly and make a loud noise reminiscent of tuning an old tv to a static channel. I was worried it was going to explode, honestly. I emailed the company around 3pm the day I received the phone about the camera issue and got an automated message saying they were unavailable and to try back during normal business hours. A few days later (around 1pm on a week day) when I had discovered the other defects, I called them. After being put automatically on hold for literally 5 minutes, I got an automated ""We're busy or you called during non-business hours. Call again Mon-Fri, 9-5"". I'd be flabbergasted to learn they actually employ people for customer service because I only got repeated automated messages.

samsung,"Very nice. First of all, let me begin by saying I was an early adopter of the iPhone, the first generation was a tank until dust got the best of it (under home button). Later on moving onto Android based phones and enjoying those as well. When there was a lot of positive feedback on windows 7.5 mobile and my other phone being drowned in beef stock. I decided to take the plunge with this little gem. Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good! The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind. I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed. Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required) Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough. Adding my google account synced up my contacts/calendar/email (important since I came from using android) Another important mention for tmobile users is that you have to go to the marketplace and install the Samsung Network Profile app and select tmobile usa. After that you can send and receive MMS The picture on this screen is beautiful, the camera has a lot of customization features, the UI is simple and clean I couldn't be happier with this phone at this price point.",2012-02-22,positive,4,en,nice first let begin saying early adopter iphone first generation tank dust got best home button later moving onto android based phones enjoying well lot positive feedback windows mobile phone drowned beef stock decided take plunge little gem upon receiving phone packaging frills made nervous running phone charged battery installed additional gb micro sd card got pny microsd documentation wp takes sd card good operating system takes gb keep mind love fact delete att default applications since tmobile prepaid unlimited yes limited g edge speed updating phones software difficulty updating got backup error causing update believe front usb port using computer time used different micro usb cable mytouch plugged usb port back computer able apply updates zune software required anyway setting phone easy enough adding google account synced contactscalendaremail important since came using android another important mention tmobile users go marketplace install samsung network profile app select tmobile usa send receive mms picture screen beautiful camera lot customization features ui simple clean couldnt happier phone price point,2,2
samsung,"This might not be the phone for you. I wanted to like the A20, I really did but the A20 just seemed to have issues that was a no go for me so I returned it. Also I need to take some blame in buying this phone because I did not do my due diligence on researching the A20 before purchasing it. I received the A20 this past Sunday, July 7th, I opened the package, got the A20 set up and was ready to use it!!, I was excited. IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES!!, after getting the A20 set up, I started to have issues with it. First of all upon booting up the A20 for the first time, the greeting and instructions were in a foreign language, now that's not a big concern or issue but it did make me wonder and think ""that's kinda of unusual"". The phone started to lag between transitions of switching apps and would freeze for a second when using the internet. Now I know this phone does not have the best of the line processor in it, being a mid-range phone, but I at least expected somewhat of a decent user experience. Also the UI interface of the A20 lags as well sometimes. The A20 also kept self closing out when I was using the internet. For about 2 minutes when I kept trying to use the internet after about 30 seconds into reading a website the A20 would just crash and close out from the internet. I was so frustrated. This last part is on me because I didnât due my diligence before purchasing this phone. Now I knew this phone didn't have a notification led light but I still was going to purchase it because I figured it would have the ""always on display"" for notifications. NOPE!!, WRONG!!! the A20 doesn't have ""always on display"" either, which means you have to check your phone manually to see if you have missed calls, texts or notifications. Now I know whoever reads this review might say ""so what you have to check the phone manually, what's wrong with that?, I'm making a big deal out of nothing"" Well, for me once you use a phone that has notifications LED and always on display, it's hard to go back to checking your phone manually for any missed notifications. Now this phone is nice, it has a 6.4 inch super amoled almost bezel-less screen, which is great for media consumption but the resolution is only 720 tops.

samsung,"They don't last very long under heavy usage. I have been using these phones for years with my $30month plan. They were a little over $12 for years at WalMart, then they dropped to $9 at WalMart, and now they don't sell them at all anymore. I don't know why they are now close to $40. And the replacement for them is also close to $40. I love the phones but I can say that they die OFTEN, for good. I probably replace mine every few months and I have had some brand new ones that have only lasted 2 weeks. For a long time I would just open a ticket with Samsung and they would send me a new one, or repair the broken one and they would pay shipping both ways. The symptom EVERY TIME was that the phone would just stick on the red Verizon screen and wouldn't power down, or up even if I removed the battery. But once they were only 9 or 12 bucks, it wasn't worth my time to go through the whole Samsung repair ticket, take phone to UPS, etc. So I just always carry a spare in the glove compartment.

samsung,"EXTENSIVE review!!!!. Want to start off by introducing myself. I am a 19 year old male who enjoys technology. I am NOT a heavy user (maybe 90 minutes a day using my phone except for 6-8 hours playing music), but I do spend very many hours with a new device learning every nook and cranny of it as quickly as possible. This phone is a very interesting phone. The layout is VERY similar to a smartphone, however it is NOT a smartphone at all. It is what is called a feature phone; one of the smartest and most advanced ones made as of 2013. It feels a bit smallish. To give you an idea of the size of the screen, take a 3X5 index card (the kind with lines) and fold it in thirds (90Â° angle to the lines). Now â?cut off one of the thirds and trim off the top of the card along the red line. This is the exact size of the screen. 2 stars for screen size. It's way too small. The battery life though, probably due in part to the screen size and basic-ness of the phone, is incredible!!!! If you use your phone heavily, as in all day long from 6AM until midnight, you can use it all day without a charge. If you don't use your phone much, it can go MANY days without a charge. I think I have had up to about 4 days on my phone, but I tend to have it running a good bit for music over headphones. 5 stars for the battery life! Here is a list of the built-in features: - texting (conversation layout. Relies on the memory capacity of the phone's built-in storage. If you intend to text on this phone but also have media stored on it too, PURCHASE A MEMORY CARD!!!!! It supports multimedia messages. I am running T-Mobile on it and I have NOT been able to successfully send any multimedia as of yet. I can however receive all of them. This is a carrier problem, not a phone problem. The touch screen keyboard however is very difficult to use. I love touchscreens (I have an iPod touch, an iPhone, and have handled MANY MANY different smartphones. This is the most difficult touchscreen keyboard I have ever used. It can be used but it is difficult and will slow you down. Use with patience. Calibration (at least with this phone) may be off slightly and differs with each key. Small size doesn't help any. It is NOT impossible to use and I have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better with it over the past month. 3 stars for texting and keyboard. - calling (supports 3+ way calling, however I have never needed to use this feature so I cannot review this feature. Calling is pretty good but not excellent. At times especially at the beginning of a call I can faintly hear my voice with varying lag times, from nearly at the same time, to up to a second behind. 4 stars for calling. - connectivity. Yes it has wifi. It's good, however it will not be anything different than its 3G connection. And it's basic 3G, nothing fancy. Not too fast but works okay. 4 stars for connectivity, both for 3G and wifi - Screenshots!!!!!! :) push the bottom middle button and the power button on the top right side at the same time. - FM radio, a very good one at that. Must use headphones for radio to work. It records too! Excellent quality recordings. Very high quality. What you hear on the radio is exactly what the recording will be. In fact if you use the music player to play back your recordings, it has an audio plack mode called 5.1CH. I don't know what that stands for, but it makes the tones sound deep and rich. I cannot gett over the quality of the output. 5 stars for the radio! - Music player. Exactly the same look and layout of a Samsung Galaxy. It plays much better and significantly louder than almost any other feature phone. I have owned 6 feature phones in my life. This one is the best one for music. 5 stars for the music player! Just be sure to purchase a memory card. - Camera. Rear-facing only. 3.2mp (megapixels), no flash. It's actually pretty good for what it is. Max resolution is 2048X1536. Here is the resolution list in MP settings â?3.2, 2.4, 2, 1.5, 1.3, and 2 for 0.1 mp: 400X240 and 320X240. The camera is highly customizable both before and after the picture is taken. It is full of very very many different editing options (for one who has the time to fish around for the fun of it) but they are all basic in nature. You can change color schemes, sharpen and blur images, even add basic clip art, words, and change font and color of words! It is an absolute blast to play with the camera. 5 stars for the camera!!!!!!! - Web browser. No exaggeration folks, but it stinks. Possibly the worst browser I've ever had. Most sites CANNOT load completely. It says it has run out of memory. The browser is sickeningly depressing. One star. However, it CAN DO YOUTUBE and it operates nicely on that site!!!!! (VERY WEIRD) The audio quality is somewhat poor and slightly garbled, and the videos aren't very clear and they are kind of grainy, but for how poor this browser is, it's shocking that it works!!!! It runs quickly and smoothly. 3 stars for YouTube. - Calculator. Very very good for a feature phone!!!! Comes with many features!!!! You can even scroll through all your old calculations! It is however a European phone and the decimals â?are, well, â?commas. Kind of different, but not bad! 5 stars for calculator hands-down! Incredible! Dictionary. Lots of words, a few unusual ones, but chances are that if you are a person with a very good education, and you need to reach for the dictionary, you will only find your word half the time. The definitions are broken down into extremely simple terms. EXAMPLE: Complicated: If you say that something is complicated, you mean it has so many parts or aspects that it is difficult to understand or deal with. And then there are examples of uses of the word. 4 stars for dictionary. - Notes. Good for what it is for. Basic. No need to elaborate. 3 stars because of keyboard. - clock, alarm clock, stopwatch, tasks â?they all work very well. 5 stars. - calendar. Very good! Lots of things you can do with it. Very much like an iPhone calendar! 5 stars. - have not used twitter Facebook or all that other social media stuff. Cannot write a review on that - email. Plugged in all the correct information and it refused to work on both 3G and on wifi. Phone problem, not carrier or my fault. - Voice memos. Works as good as any other device. They are all almost the same. Records for 12 hours. 4 stars??? I don't know. Hard to say for sure. - Samsung apps and widget store. Blah. Stinks. Very little stuff at all. Most of it can't even be downloaded. Sometimes the very basic site itself can't even load because it says not enough memory. 1 star. - Games. Can download and run any 240X400 J2ME app for touchscreen phones. Expect only the most basic functionality of it though. The best place I have found for these apps is a place called umnet.com. Be sure to do your browsing on the COMPUTER!!!!! This phone can't load that site. There is a download page the phone can use and it is umnet.net instead. Have fun. 4 stars, but keep in mind, it's 4 stars for what it is DESIGNED to do, not for how good it is compared to a smartphone!!!!!! Well that's about it! If you are going to PURCHASE this phone, here are some helpful tips. The phone kind of has TWO DIFFERENT screen formats, each with their own style, format, layout, whatever you call it. When you ""slide to unlock"" the first thing you will see is a background with these app-lookin thingies called widgets. These make your phone run heavy, however they can be helpful little tools. These are downloaded from the samsung App Store. These can be added and removed by tapping the widget button on the top left of the screen. A row of app icons will appear at the bottom of the screen. Those are all your widgets. You can scroll through those. To open them, slide them vertically out of the row and onto the screen. To close them, slide them off the screen down into the little scrolling row. To edit the number of screens, STILL IN WIDGET MODE, turn the screen horizontally (landscape mode) the + signs add screens, the delete symbols delete screens. Press the done button when you are finished with your editing. The other apps screen is when you push the middle home button. These are all your real apps I wrote a review on. These CANNOT be moved to your widget screen. To leave the apps screen press the end call button on the right side of the middle button. When you open an app if you press the home button it takes you to the apps screen and the power button takes you to the widgets screen. Many apps can all run at the same time. To force close programs, hold down the home button. Tap the delete button to force close. On any screen if you run your finger from the very top of the screen downward, it opens your notification and quick settings tab. You can turn on and off wifi, Bluetooth, and silent mode from here. Also if you have your music or radio running, all that can be changed from here as well â?change track, play and pause, and change frequency or pause radio in the

samsung,"I hate this phone!!!. Honestly, this phone sucks. It constantly lags, closes apps for no reason, gets a horrible connection to my service provider compared to the other phones in my household a Honor 7x and a Huawei P20 Lite. It has lagged multiple times with nothing else running just while typing this. I will never buy another Samsung phone. Just an example you will be typing and on the third letter it will freeze, you type it three or four times and nothing, then it unfreezes and you have 3 or 4 of the letter you were trying to type. It does this 5 to 6 times while typing 25 words. It is annoying as hell. I have had much better phones in this price range from other companies. After about 35 years of Samsung being my go-to electronics company, LG and Huawei in most things that overlap with Samsung are sadly better now it seems from my recent experiences. Sad when a brand you once trusted now becomes just another name. Update 12/20/2019 I still hate this phone, nothing has been fixed by updates, if anything it has gotten worse. I was just clicking the right button at the bottom that usually shows all apps, instead of it minimalizing the app that was open and letting you slide between open apps it kept pulling down the top pull-down-menu or switching back to the open app in full-screen mode. In order to get the app to close I had to restart the phone. It would be one thing if I had some random third-party app open but it was Google Maps. The screen lags horribly, the processor is slow. The cheap ZTE I had in 2013 was a better functioning and faster phone, I have had smartphones from Samsung, Microsoft(Lumia 950XL), Apple, Motorola, ASUS, ZTE, Huawei (which the P30 and Honor 7XL were by far the best-operating phones I have had besides the Microsoft which the only shortcoming was the lack of apps. I really wanted to get the Note 10 plus 5g LTE but after this experience over the last 7 months with this phone, I just can't pull the trigger on that expensive of a phone. Samsung may still get me with the 11 series when they are released in 2020 but if I have any problems like this phone I will never buy another Samsung phone again. I shouldn't have to buy a $1000 phone from Samsung to beat a $250 phone from Honor or a $550 phone from Huawei. Honestly, the ZTE mini Axon($175) and the ASUS Zenfone (under $250) were much better phones and bought in 2017/2016.",2019-07-09,negative,1,en,hate phone honestly phone sucks constantly lags closes apps reason gets horrible connection service provider compared phones household honor x huawei p lite lagged multiple times nothing else running typing never buy another samsung phone example typing third letter freeze type three four times nothing unfreezes letter trying type times typing words annoying hell much better phones price range companies years samsung goto electronics company lg huawei things overlap samsung sadly better seems recent experiences sad brand trusted becomes another name update still hate phone nothing fixed updates anything gotten worse clicking right button bottom usually shows apps instead minimalizing app open letting slide open apps kept pulling top pulldownmenu switching back open app fullscreen mode order get app close restart phone would one thing random thirdparty app open google maps screen lags horribly processor slow cheap zte better functioning faster phone smartphones samsung microsoftlumia xl apple motorola asus zte huawei p honor xl far bestoperating phones besides microsoft shortcoming lack apps really wanted get note plus g lte experience last months phone cant pull trigger expensive phone samsung may still get series released problems like phone never buy another samsung phone shouldnt buy phone samsung beat phone honor phone huawei honestly zte mini axon asus zenfone much better phones bought,0,0

I upgraded to this after having the S3 for the past year and a half (after being a devoted IPhone user) and I couldn't be happier. The S3 was a solid phone in terms of features and design, but the battery life was horrible. The only thing that was holding me back from upgrading to another Samsung was how large the screens have been getting and cheap build quality. When I heard about the Alpha I was ecstatic. It looks sexy, feels solid and I can use it with one hand (I have child sized hands) . Despite the smaller battery the life is good, I get a full day with very heavy use and the brightness all the way up and I don't need to charge it till the night.

samsung,"To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because .... X-posted from Verizon. Read plenty of online reviews about the Edge before preordering it, most mentioned the ""gimmick"" that is the curved screen because of lack of functionality. To my mind this is a little like saying flat panel computer monitors were a gimmick because they did everything a CRT did -- they showed the picture, after all, they were just skinnier. ""All show, folks, nothing here to see, move along..."" Not so much. Now, what is a gimmick is the software that has been developed in order fend off complaints that the curved screen's real-estate isn't used efficiently. Edge contacts? Not all that essential or useful. Edge notifications? Same deal. What is really impressive is the effect the curved screen has on my viewing experience. One reviewer on another site wrote ""...gives the disturbing impression that the screen is falling away from me."" I balked at this because my experience is precisely the opposite, specifically that the screen is rising up to me. I hesitate to call it a 3D experience because that cheapens a true 3D display through something like MagicLeap, but it truly gives the impression that the screen has depth...because, well, it does. This is particularly noticed when using ""carousels"" to swipe through items on mobile websites & apps, e.g. Netflix. The items roll up one side of the screen then off the other to produce a more immersive experience. Same can be said about scrolling on Web pages while in landscape mode. Another cool/useful effect is when watching videos the ""edge"" is blacked out preventing distortion of the image but also provides a little extra screen space for widescreen movies. Also when swiping down to check notifications/battery life the notification & progress bar make use of the edge; in effect using less screen space & obscuring less of the video. The QHD display is also excellent with no pixellation visible under a hand lens. Enough about the screen. Processor & RAM make Android 5.0 run like a dream. I owned an S5 before picking up this gem & seriously regretted updating to Lollipop because the S5 just didn't handle it well -- abominable battery life, laaaaag, & it required multiple restarts through the day. None of these problems are evident on the S6. Battery life is good, but not excellent. Can stream videos for about six hours before it needs to be charged & survives a typical day with intermittent usage for ten to twelve hours. The real improvement here is the inclusion of wireless charging. I decided to forego the add-on backplate/battery for the S5 so I picked up a few wireless charging options this go around & I'm thrilled with the functionality. I have one in my car, on the end table, the bedside table & my desk. The convenience of being able to just drop/dock-&-go cannot be overstated & as a result my battery is seldom below 70%. The only improvement I can imagine is if they could figure out how to make my body a wireless charger. TouchWiz is a bit of a let-down, but not significantly so. It is stripped down so I'm not completely inundated with an UI that had the feeling of being added to with each iteration to ""improve"" it, as if adding every spice in the cupboard makes for a better soup. The app drawer is my biggest irritation because it is entirely inconvenient. Newly installed apps are added to the end of the list but apps can be sorted into alphabetical order by touching the A-Z at the top of the list. Now why is this irritating? First, it needs to be done each time you install an app. Second, while you can customize the app list to include your most frequently accessed apps on the first page so you don't have an entire screen dedicated to app icons that should properly be housed in the app drawer, the customization process is poorly designed, unintuitive & languid in end-user implementation. Third, after spending a great deal of time customizing the first page of the app drawer the next time you want to sort your apps alphabetically you lose all of your customization. Like every other device, this one is rife with pre-installed apps. I didn't do a whole lot of poking around to see if they could all be disabled, but every useless bit of bloatware I wanted gone -- NFL Mobile, all verizon apps except MyVerizon, Milk, Slacker, Facebook, etc. -- was easily disabled. NFC is better implemented than in the S5 resulting in less shifting about to find a ""sweet spot"" so I can more easily use Google Wallet. No problems with BT as there were in the S5, specifically a problem I had with using BT devices such as my fitbit that caused WiFi to go on the fritz while BT was active. IR transmitter is superb & the included Peel Smart Remote app took less than a minutes to configure for both my television & DirecTV box & I haven't needed to reach for a remote since. I'm not a camera junkie & I seldom take pictures of anything other than my dog being an idiot, but I have to admit that the pictures look pretty amazing. Given my limited experience, the editing tools where pretty intuitive but tbh, I only cropped a few Pics. Aside from the screen & performance & wireless charging another real improvement is in the audio when compared to my previous devices. Mind you, just as I'm not a camera junkie, I'm also not an audiophile. Like my previous handsets this has a single speaker, but unlike those it is set in the bottom edge of the phone rather than the back. I used to have to turn the volume to max & cup my hand around the back of my S5 to get decent audio but whether the S6's speaker is so significantly improved or its placement is better or a combination of the two, this thing is LOUD! I usually turn on an audio book to fall asleep to & actually had to turn this down to 50% because it was disturbing my sleep. I do occasionally cover the speaker when holding the device in landscape mode, but that's just because I haven't become fully acclimated to the device. Finally, the form-factor -- that I adore -- will require quite the adjustment from what we've all learned to be standard. It's really an excellent lesson in how uninnovative handset manufacturers have been in re-imagining both the means of delivering content & our interaction with that content -- the screen. When I reach into my pocket I want to grab the rounded bit so I can look at the flat side, because that's the screen, right? The Edge changes that paradigm, perhaps not drastically, but it changes it nonetheless. In my pre-purchase review reading some evaluators considered this an ""ergonomic problem"", some felt that their fingers hit the edge; I've found neither to be a problem. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad & with consistent use I've found my fingers fit quite comfortably on the aluminum surround without messing with the screen. Form-wise, it is instantly recognizable as a S-Series phone, but this iteration is a superb high-end rendering of that aesthetic. Although I run the risk of overstating how visually appealing this device is, I am willing to label it an objet d'art. One that I was almost afraid to use due to its apparent fragility until a few accidental drops on tile confirmed that it is as durable as it is beautiful as it is functional.

samsung,"Waste of Time and Effort. The phone I purchased as new was not new. It was an open box at best. The phone came with no sim card and it has been a nightmare trying to get one. I tried to buy a sim card at Walmart. I was sold a prepaid sim card, that doesn't say prepaid anywhere on the package. Then I called verizon wireless. They were supposed to send me a sim card. They never sent it. I went to one verizon wireless store. They had no greeter. Another customer had to tell me there was a sign in sheet, and a queue that was at least two people deep. I left. I went to another verizon wireless store. I walked in and no store personnel spoke to me until I started talking to other customers. Then, the greeter finally came over to sign us in. Waited for a while. Someone finally came over and started and started talking to me. They weren't wearing a verizon wireless shirt, and didn't tell me who they were. After several seconds, I finally determined on my own they were a store employee. They looked at my account, everything was good. They asked me for my phone. I explained that I wanted to activate the phone myself. They told me they couldn't give me a sim card and let me activate my own phone. I left. I still have a phone, a bill, and no sim card.

samsung,"Full 4G LTE on ATT - $300 Less than ATT Version and Unlocked without Bloatware. I'm reviewing the SM-G955FD unlocked model of the Galaxy 8+ sold by BuyeRush. I've bought quite a few unlocked international phones from Amazon and the results can be inconsistent. Twice I've received what appears to be proper full retail packaging with the manufacturer seal still in place. Another time I received was was clearly a knock off manual that was barely readable along with knock off packaging adding suspicion it was previously a floor model or refurbished. Another time the right basic phone but wrong model - an ATT branded version instead of an unlocked international version. Fortunately I received the right model from seller BuyeRush. Keep in mind the same listing may sometimes be supplied by multiple sellers with different standards in quality. The S8+ I received was in full retail packaging with the original seal still intact and included all the original accessories and additionally a plug converter since the ones included were for foreign plugs. The S8+ is a big phone. It feels like a slim, glossy, oddly weighted thing that wants to jump out of your hand at any moment. Definitely get a case with good grip on it. The screen is the best I've ever seen and works great in the Samsung Gear VR. App's run very good in VR too. To the point I forgot they are being powered by a phone. The particular model supplied by BuyeRush is also the cleanest ROM I've ever seen. That is to say there is not a ton of junk pre-installed on the phone. Particularly in the US you will end up with lots of carrier branded junk pre-installed on the phone eating up internal storage space that you cannot recover. The apps will also be un-installable though you can disable them after phone updates they have a tendency to still try to download updates themselves or otherwise just eat up battery life. All but 1 app that I wanted to remove has been fully uninstallable. The Bixby button is a little oddly placed but the main screen option is easily removed and the button can be fully disabled from within My Samsung also. Besides the size being a little akward for me personally, though some people might prefer it, the only thing real criticism I have is with a Samsung software update that appears to result in the built in gallery no longer asking what application to open video files with. Resetting default apps has no effect. Only reason I mention this is because the default app does not support codecs for videos recorded by multiple devices and in the past I could browse in gallery and then open in VLC. For ATT Users: Initially I could only get HSPA+ with my old SIM. Going into the APN settings I could not even connect to the NextGen selection. I ended up having to get a new SIM and also I was on the original true unlimited data plan from many years ago. This created some sort of conflict requiring me to switch to the new ""unlimited"" (throttled at 22 GB) data plan. I now get up to 100 Mbs down and 20 Mbs up Also keep in mind ATT is rolling out ""5G E"". This is not really 5G and if you have a non-branded phone it will likely still display it as 4G. If you have a branded phone it will show 5G E. Att did the same thing by forcing branded phones to display 4G for HSPA+ This phone currently supports all but 2 of the band + frequency combinations for ATT USA.",2019-01-30,positive,5,en,full g lte att less att version unlocked without bloatware im reviewing smgfd unlocked model galaxy sold buyerush ive bought quite unlocked international phones amazon results inconsistent twice ive received appears proper full retail packaging manufacturer seal still place another time received clearly knock manual barely readable along knock packaging adding suspicion previously floor model refurbished another time right basic phone wrong model att branded version instead unlocked international version fortunately received right model seller buyerush keep mind listing may sometimes supplied multiple sellers different standards quality received full retail packaging original seal still intact included original accessories additionally plug converter since ones included foreign plugs big phone feels like slim glossy oddly weighted thing wants jump hand moment definitely get case good grip screen best ive ever seen works great samsung gear vr apps run good vr point forgot powered phone particular model supplied buyerush also cleanest rom ive ever seen say ton junk preinstalled phone particularly us end lots carrier branded junk preinstalled phone eating internal storage space cannot recover apps also uninstallable though disable phone updates tendency still try download updates otherwise eat battery life app wanted remove fully uninstallable bixby button little oddly placed main screen option easily removed button fully disabled within samsung also besides size little akward personally though people might prefer thing real criticism samsung software update appears result built gallery longer asking application open video files resetting default apps effect reason mention default app support codecs videos recorded multiple devices past could browse gallery open vlc att users initially could get hspa old sim going apn settings could even connect nextgen selection ended get new sim also original true unlimited data plan many years ago created sort conflict requiring switch new unlimited throttled gb data plan get mbs mbs also keep mind att rolling g e really g nonbranded phone likely still display g branded phone show g e att thing forcing branded phones display g hspa phone currently supports band frequency combinations att usa,2,1

samsung,"Could only be better if someone other than Samsung made it. I love the phone. It has worked superbly for me. I came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time. There are two things I'd like to talk about with this phone: Size, and Samsung's Customer Service. Size: I can never go back to a smaller screen. I really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that I almost drop it sometimes when I don't have a good grip on it. I love having so much screen real estate! I love it and I will never go back. In general though, I don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature. I'm 6'2"" so I'm somewhat taller than average, so it may be that I'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit. Samsung's Customer Service: Terrible. I don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done. I don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way. That's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone. Get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better! Anyway, it started with my phone arriving. I opened the box and got right into everything, then noticed that there wasn't an included headset. I just thought, ""Wow, are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset(that probably costs them $1 to make) with their most expensive phone?"" So I contacted customer service to see if there was any way I could get one. I had sold my pair of Beats headphones since I don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking I'd use the stock headset that I thought would come with it. I basically got a flat ""no."" My next aggravation came when I saw a news article that said ""Free $50 Google Play credit for Note 3 Customers."" I quickly made my way to the link provided, only to be met with a screen that said ""Due to the high demand, we have run out of our supply of credits. Thank you for your interest!"" The promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks. Really Samsung? I contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits. Again, a flat ""no."" These are somewhat little things, but it's the little things that make good customer service, and I feel like Samsung fails miserably in that department.",2013-12-17,positive,5,en,could better someone samsung made love phone worked superbly came much simpler phone getting used options bit challenging fun time two things id like talk phone size samsungs customer service size never go back smaller screen really dont care sometimes tough reach letters texting almost drop sometimes dont good grip love much screen real estate love never go back general though dont much trouble texting using one handed even without enabling special one handed use feature im im somewhat taller average may im large enough size good fit samsungs customer service terrible dont think really get supposed done dont think really understand please customers right way thats probably many useless features piled phone get rid make others plain work better anyway started phone arriving opened box got right everything noticed wasnt included headset thought wow really cheap cant even include headsetthat probably costs make expensive phone contacted customer service see way could get one sold pair beats headphones since dont listen music much anymore thinking id use stock headset thought would come basically got flat next aggravation came saw news article said free google play credit note customers quickly made way link provided met screen said due high demand run supply credits thank interest promotion supposed run months instead lasted less weeks really samsung contacted customer service see way disgruntled customer could get free credits flat somewhat little things little things make good customer service feel like samsung fails miserably department,2,2

The phone is Unlocked, but the Verizon system does not always recognize the IMEI number. I went to the local Verizon store, and the computer would not allow the employee to start the process. I went home, contacted Amazon about the issue, and was set up with a replacement. As I did more research on if even a replacement would work, I found a link on the Verizon Support Site where you can manually enter an IMEI number and it will tell you if it is compatible. I did, and was told my phone was a perfect match. I went back to the store and passed this on to the employee. He tried two more times, both bar code and manually entering the numbers. No luck. He suggested that since the online support site said it was good, maybe dialing *611 and speaking with a tech would help. This was a good suggestion. I explained the situation, gave the tech the IMEI code, and off it went. There were several more steps, one involving the serial number of the SIM Card that would be going in the new phone, but he was able to input the phone in the system. About 25, 30 minutes later, it was all done. I hurried back to cancel the replacement phone. Very good customer service from both Amazon and Verizon.

samsung,"Not as Active as you think it is. The 1 star is mostly based on my experienced with their technical repair.Â  The Samsung Galaxy S6 active is the latest iteration of samsungs famed Active line. If you're looking into this phone, you should know the phone is made to protect against the elements: Heat, water and dust. I've always been a loyal iPhone user but the two times I've switched have been for samsungs active phones. Last years S5 active was an excellent phone. The OS was fast and efficient, the battery life was good and I used it in the pool, mud and dropped it various times without any issues. But I grew nostalgic and went back to the iPhone. When the S6 active came out with an even better battery life and no need to place the tab over the charging area, I was sold. I wasn't going back to the iPhone ever again! Two weeks into it... I regret ever getting this phone and I'll never go to Samsung again.Â  A week ago, I went to the beach and entered the water with it. My girlfriend had some apprehension at first but she saw that I was taking photos without any issues. A few minutes later, I received a call and I couldn't hear the caller. I dried my phone and attempted to call back with the same results. Then I tried to play music and the volume was very low. I inserted my headphones but the phone didn't realize I did. That night, I tried to charge my phone but it wasn't charging. The next day, I go to an AT&T store and they tell me that I would have to call a technical service rep. The rep referred me over to Samsung Technical people. The Samsung people referred me to Best Buy who referred me to the Samsung Experience store. At the store in SOHO, they say they can't repair the phone since they don't have the equipment for it. I call Samsung who then tells me to mail it to Dallas and, best of all, my warranty may be voided since it may have sustained water damage. Essentially, Samsung is saying this phone is for those who are physically active and it's okay to get wet. But the customer is liable if it fails to do what it's purposely built to do. I am furious. I have never had this issue with an iPhone. I've dropped, broken, cracked, spilt water, etc on an iPhone and it gets repaired immediately without hiccups. Meanwhile, Samsung sits back and wonders why their market share is going down the tank. Do not advertise that a phone can withstand all sorts of physical hazards if it doesn't. And if it doesn't, then Samsung should back it up on their warranty.Â  I am never owning a Samsung ever again.",2015-07-30,negative,1,en,active think star mostly based experienced technical repaira samsung galaxy active latest iteration samsungs famed active line youre looking phone know phone made protect elements heat water dust ive always loyal iphone user two times ive switched samsungs active phones last years active excellent phone os fast efficient battery life good used pool mud dropped various times without issues grew nostalgic went back iphone active came even better battery life need place tab charging area sold wasnt going back iphone ever two weeks regret ever getting phone ill never go samsung againa week ago went beach entered water girlfriend apprehension first saw taking photos without issues minutes later received call couldnt hear caller dried phone attempted call back results tried play music volume low inserted headphones phone didnt realize night tried charge phone wasnt charging next day go att store tell would call technical service rep rep referred samsung technical people samsung people referred best buy referred samsung experience store store soho say cant repair phone since dont equipment call samsung tells mail dallas best warranty may voided since may sustained water damage essentially samsung saying phone physically active okay get wet customer liable fails purposely built furious never issue iphone ive dropped broken cracked spilt water etc iphone gets repaired immediately without hiccups meanwhile samsung sits back wonders market share going tank advertise phone withstand sorts physical hazards doesnt doesnt samsung back warrantya never owning samsung ever,0,2

samsung,"After two years, it still feels like a brand new phone!. Bought this used for $270 on Amazon. Owned the phone for less than a week but I'm very impressed. (Probably new-toy syndrome.) Too easy to set up with Ting... just dropped a 128GB microSD card and the SIM card into it. Initial setup was, as always, easy with Android. I flashed Android Pie onto it with no issues, although I had to do it with ODIN as opposed to Smart Switch or Kies because I found out Samsung disabled this feature from both programs (server-side, so older versions will not work). It is physically a very sleek phone. It also feels very sleek... and slippery, and a huge fingerprint magnet. After I cleaned off my grubby paw prints, I slapped a case onto it. The screen itself is rather large and very generous with space. I have smaller hands but I can still comfortably (barely) use gesture typing with just my thumb. I am not a stylus user but trying... the stylus fits neatly into its slot at the bottom right of the phone. The phone's performance is... well, brand new. I can't get it to lag (yet). I'm not a super power user and like to keep things simple, so I haven't tested any crazy 3D gaming yet. (I've included my app list below, just to give you an idea of what I run on this thing.) It's nice to finally have a phone that keeps up with me. The camera is beautiful so far. I haven't used it as much as I want to yet but I have faith this will be better than my broken camera on my S7 Edge. Plenty of options in the app... nice, sharp, and colorful! Call quality seems fine... not tinny, not terrible, good to go. Network connectivity to WiFi is as fast as any of my laptops. Haven't tested tethering or anything like that yet. More to follow as I play around with it! - - Gmail - Disa - Hangouts - WhatsApp - Google Maps - Here WeGo - Adobe Lightroom - GoPro - Google Photos - SJCAM - Google Chrome - Netguard - Tasker - Timely - Aldiko Classic - Amazon Kindle - Amazon Music - Dropbox - Duolingo - YouTube UPDATE 20190906: Still pretty happy with the phone. Delved into VR use... it is pretty nice considering the battery drain while using it isn't as bad as my Galaxy Edge S7, plus it is fun to use! (Don't bother with the 2016 version of the Samsung Gear... it will mar any screen protectors and it is a super-tight fit with the connector AND the other side.) No lag so far with what I've used for Oculus Apps.

One, it came with great Memory right out of the box. Two, no lag (very speedy between apps), Three, the stylus is Great!! I love to write notes and having extra features built into the stylus is just a bonus. Finally the Screen itself is just stunning. Pictures and movies are amazing on this display. It's large... but not to large. Even with the Phone protector (a Defender Otter Box) on its really not that big and fits into my pockets easy. I purchased additional memory for the already ample amount of memory that was on the phone already. I just wanted to keep my books and movies separate. The primary reason why I got this phone is to replace my old LG Stylo 2. This was a large phone as well with a stylus. It had only 16GB of memory. I had this phone for several years and it still works fairly well. However, the battery was giving out on it and the memory was less than adequate. These were the primary reasons to upgrade.

($33/mo for 24 months) This phone was half the cost of Verizon. The only downside, it did not come with a Nano Sim card. No problem, you can go to Verizon and they'll install a new sim card and if you aren't changing plans, it won't cost a dime. Yippee! And I asked Verizon what size SSD card it would support.

samsung,"Good but could be better. The good: -Really nice design and great looking phone -Probably the best hardware on any flagship phone at this time 11/2019 - fullscreen bezeless - large sturdy screen that's durable and the body is quite resistant to bending for a phone this size - supports adding sd card storage of 1tab sdcards extending the 256gb + 1tb total storage = you'll never have to worry about running out of room for photos and videos on your phone ever again - 4k video, slow motion, and super slow motion -video motion stabilization is really good - snapdragon 855 processor means its fast really fast - nice stylus pen and can act as remote for some phone functions like camera controls - it has a thin film screen protector installed by default - you can set default storage of camera and downloads to sdcard and save your phone storage - Multitasking is very fast and very smooth - wireless charging and wireless power transfer The bad: - The onscreen fingerprint reader sucks, it doesn't work with most screen protectors and even when it does it will fail at least 30% of the time and is exceedingly frustrating if you need to unlock the phone in a jiffy for photos or videos - the facial recognition so fails about that much and if you change your hairstyle or wear glasses and then stop it will not recognize you sometimes. - the facial recognition requires good lighting or it will fail almost 100% of the time in the dark, this means if you're out on the streets or at a festival with minimal lighting it will not recognize your face - it has a thin film screen protector installed by default that could interfere with additional screen protectors unless you remove it, but you'd have to know there was one in the first place which is not mentioned - the default samsung camera software is inferior n picture taking to even the pixel 3 camera, I installed the google cam and use that instead of the Samsung camera in normal photo situations. The Samsung cam over saturates and loses detail in photos where the google can will capture more realistic results with more details and less photoshopped results that make the photos look almost fake. - The default samsung messaging app is also really bad, it will compress any images and videos to such a degree that it will be totally blurry of you send things over SMS. It will also limit the size you can send beyond what other phones allow. Images you send will be subpar and pixelated. I had to switch to the google messenger downloaded from the play store; it is superior in every way and I can send things over like I was able to on my iPhone; the quality is much better than the compressed mess the Samsung default message app was doing - the navigation swipes are hard to do sometimes due to the size of the screen and the keyboard layouts are not well designed for one handed use even in one handed mode, I had a much better one handed experience on my note4. - this phone is near impossible to operate with just one hand most of the time - the placement of the camera in the top left corner means when you try to take photos in landscape mode your fingers can easily obstruct a portion of the camera and show up in your photos. They should've kept it like the S10 where it's in the middle of the phone so your fingers would be a lot less likely to get in the way of the camera lense. I haven't owned a note since the note 4, so for me this was a huge improvement in most areas and I was waiting for a fullscreen bezeless phone with an onscreen fingerprint reader so that's why I chose the note 10+ over the pixel 4xl. I also wanted the flagship phone with all the bells and whistles so I chose it over the s10+. I switched from a note to iPhone and being pissed at iPhone's limitations after 5 years, mostly related to storage and random apps disappearing into icloud, I decided I needed to go back to android and was waiting for the right phone. I am overall very satisfied with the phone in the $600-700 price range, but wouldn't get it in the $1000 range due to some big flaws I mentioned above.

samsung,"Poor SIgnal Reception a Major Shortcoming. For the price seems like a fairly solid phone with a good feel to it. Like the multiple alarm features and a decent voice message recorder. First tried putting my known good Consumer Cellular sim card in and see if it worked. It didn't. Then tried the unlock procedure and inserted my sim card again. The phone still didn't work. Got a ""sim not allowed M#3"" error message the same as other reviewers have noted. Re-inserted the sim card and re-entered the unlock codes several times to ensure I hadn't made a mistake. Note a few web sites I visited questioned the validity of the unlock procedure for the a157V model which apparently is an upgrade of the a157 for which the unlock procedure does seem to work. Will be calling Consumer Cellular to see if I can get it to work. Otherwise it's going back to Amazon. Update - Spoke with CC technical support. They say I should be able to insert their sim card into an ATT phone, including this GO phone, and it should work as ATT phones are unlocked. Which obviously it didn't. This suggests the phone itself doesn't work. So back it goes to Amazon. Next time I'll try it out in a Best Buy store to confirm it works before I buy. Update 2 - Went to Best Buy and had a tech support rep try out my SIM card in still another new out of the box a157 phone. Again didn't work. So now CC is sending me a new SIM card to try out. Best Buy cell phone tech support rep says this phone comes unlocked and is purchased by many of their customers who travel overseas. Will update again when I get the new SIM card. Update 3 - At first it still didn't work when I installed the new SIM card. However, through experimentation I finally figured out the problem was this phone's VERY POOR SIGNAL SENSITIVITY. Finally had success where the signal outside was strong. Note there was no need to ""unlock"" a new phone I had obtained.

samsung,"iPhone User of Over 7 Years Finally Switches Over, Do It! :). After years of considering switching to Android from iOS, I finally made the move this November. I picked up a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 from Best Buy on November 1 and I will never look back. I have had iPhones since 2010 (iPhone 4 32gb; iPhone 5 32gb; and most recently an iPhone 6s Plus 64gb) and have a Mid-2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13"" that I use as a daily computer for personal, work and school purposes. The Note 8 blows every iPhone out of the water and after having seen what Apple unveiled to us this last Keynote, the iPhone 8/8 Plus (really a 7s, give or take) and the iPhone X, I knew I had enough of it. Everything switches over with ease to the Note 8 with the included adapters (you just plug your old phone into the Note 8 and choose what you want and bam, you have it). The camera is phenomenal on this phone and it has the ability to take photos that look as if they came out of a DSLR with quality blur (even without the live focus functionality turned on), it is so fast, I have the ability to have 2 different apps open at once and the S-Pen is great. This phone has made me so much more productive due to its highly usable functionality and I feel less reliant/dependent on my phone as notifications are much more discrete with the use of an LED and the always on display to show what app has a notification, without being distracting like the iPhone lighting up the entire screen. Seriously, I do not know why I never considered switching before. I was so convinced that Apple was the pinnacle of innovation until as of recent. They have not brought a single new and innovative feature in a long time and I think I will stay Samsung/Android for now. All I can say is if you have thought of switching over to Samsung from iPhone, give it a try. It is TOTALLY worth it. Until next time, Apple.

samsung,"Good, but with imperfections. So, I always buy phones outright and normally a model or two behind. To me that makes the most sense financially. When I chose the S7 edge it was replacing my S6 edge that has developed a less responsive screen and a thin purple line running down my phone. When this one came it looked to be in great condition, no scratches or dents. I turned it on and since it was refurbished I was expecting some imperfections, and the only significant one I've noticed was that the icons in the bottom of the screen (phone, text, internet, apps) were burned into the screen as if someone left the brightness on the highest setting and just let the phone sit on the home screen for a day.

When I got the phone it was locked to AT&T, but all you have to do is call their customer service line and they will give you code to unlock it. Took me a while to figure out the phone because it is my first windows phone but I think I'm getting the hang of it. I did have one other issue and that was I could not receive or send picture messaging. However once I found the right site the fix was very easy. This is how you fix it if you're having that problem. Keep in mind you will have to update your market place first (Or at least I did.) To get the ""Samsung Zone"" to appear. And please read the note at the bottom before thinking that it's not working once you get to the MMSC field.

The phone itself works like a charm, but it is NOT UNLOCKED to CDMA carriers such as Verizon and China Telecomm. I went to Verizon Corporate store and tried to put their SIM card in. It doesn't work. The store engineer queried their database using the phone's SN number and the database indicated this model is NOT CDMA COMPATIBLE! They told me they had encountered several similar incompatibilities of unlocked Note 8. Many of them were purchased from Amazon.com. A few months later I decided to try my luck at China with China Telecomm, which is also a CDMA carrier. It doesn't work either. I was told the same story about people thinking they are getting an unlocked CDMA compatible Note 8 that turned out not compatible. The real sad part is: I am quite a techie so before I made the purchase, I actually pulled out frequency band list from Verizon and China Telecomm and compared the one I acquired from Samsung tech support. It matches! I also verified with Samsung and read extensively through Amazon.com feedback and the result are ALL POSITIVE.

samsung,"Samsung S7 930T - T-mobile. I love this phone, it's just been hard to get one that works properly. So far I have received 5 Samsung S7 930T's from Amazon. The first one was supposed to be ""NEW"", but when I registered it with Samsung the warranty was already expired. Amazon took care of it. Amazon through this process has been amazing, the sellers on the other hand have been mixed. I finally started to buy ""Used, Like New"" versions because I realized there may not be any real ""New"" S7 930T's out there. The first one I received was from S. Korea, it worked perfectly for a week and then the power switch gave out. The second one was from Vietnam and it couldn't read the SD card. The third one came from China and the fingerprint sensor didn't work. The forth one came from Vietnam and it would get so hot that you couldn't keep it in your pocket. I put an app on it and it was showing the processor hitting 173Â° F. The latest one I received is from China and it's working perfectly so far. It doesn't have the battery life of the Vietnamese version but I'm just thrilled that everything is working. Depending on where the phone was manufactured the S7's software would be a little different. It's like the each country of origin had a slightly different version of Android 7.0 used. Even the bloatware was a little different from phone to phone depending where it came from. I would love to remove some Samsung software like ""Smart Things and ""Samsung Themes"" or at least disable them but it's not stock Android and you can disable the Facebook app and a few other things that I'll never use. I like the S7 because it's smaller than the S8 or S9 and it has a physical home button. The camera takes great low light pictures and videos are crisp and not oversaturated. The phone will upgrade to Android v8.0 with Security patch April 1, 2018 as soon as you let it. My suggestion is, if you buy one of these, you let it update the software before loading all your apps on it, you'll get a better experience and eleimate crashes. I would recommend this phone to anyone that wants a flagship Samsung phone for less that $250 that doesn't mind that it's probably not going to get Android 9 in the future. But with 5G around the corner, why would you want to spend $1000 on a new phone when it may be obsolete in a year or so?",2018-10-01,positive,4,en,samsung tmobile love phone hard get one works properly far received samsung ts amazon first one supposed new registered samsung warranty already expired amazon took care amazon process amazing sellers hand mixed finally started buy used like new versions realized may real new ts first one received korea worked perfectly week power switch gave second one vietnam couldnt read sd card third one came china fingerprint sensor didnt work forth one came vietnam would get hot couldnt keep pocket put app showing processor hitting adeg f latest one received china working perfectly far doesnt battery life vietnamese version im thrilled everything working depending phone manufactured ss software would little different like country origin slightly different version android used even bloatware little different phone phone depending came would love remove samsung software like smart things samsung themes least disable stock android disable facebook app things ill never use like smaller physical home button camera takes great low light pictures videos crisp oversaturated phone upgrade android v security patch april soon let suggestion buy one let update software loading apps youll get better experience eleimate crashes would recommend phone anyone wants flagship samsung phone less doesnt mind probably going get android future g around corner would want spend new phone may obsolete year,2,2

However, I absolutely hate the software. This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone, and supposedly, the S6 has a less obtrusive touchwhiz software compared to older galaxy phones. I'm coming from various Nexus phones, so I used to the vanilla-ness and snappiness of the Nexus phones. I now understand the touchwhiz hate. This biggest problem with the touchwhiz on S6 edge is lag. The lag is absolutely excruciating, and the initial lag on the lock screen is so awful. I have issues putting in the 4 pins to unlock this phone because the lag is so bad. After the phone unlocks, it takes awhile for the phone to get going. Occasionally, if you open an app to quickly after unlocking the phone, there could be a 30 second freeze. If you have music going while unlocking the phone, lag can potentially go on for eternity. Once the phone is up and running, it does run smooth. It's been 3 months, and I think the lag has somewhat gotten worse (not sure if this was due to the latest touchwhiz lollipop update). As for the Samsung apps themselves, my thoughts are 'meh'. I don't hate them, but I disabled what I could. I sort of like the S health which counts my steps. As for the battery, it's about average. The Nexus phones were about average for battery also, so no real change for me. I do think the S6 edge is slightly worse, but I think lots of the battery issues are due to TouchWhiz. Even with non-use, I can feel the phone getting hot in my pocket, and I'm sure the Samsung apps are just going crazy in the background. I don't take lots of pictures with my phone, but the camera is top notch. Maybe I would love this phone more, if I took more picture. Cyanogenmod folks have yet to crack this phone because of the proprietary chip exynos. If I can get another OS on this phone, such as vanilla android or cyanogenmod, I would do it in a heartbeat. Unless I can get acceptable OS on this phone, I'll likely go back to the Nexus (or Android Silver) when the next one is released this fall/winter. tl;dr Looks and the aesthetics: 5 stars, This phone is currently the best looking phone. Software: 1 star, I absolutely loathe TouchWhiz and the lag.

All I did was take it to my service provider and in 5-10 min they activated the phone for a 15$ fee which was fine. I hope any of you who intend to buy the phone will follow what I did. If the phone is truly unlocked then just putting the sim in will work, at least I assume. If not, then take it to your service provider's store and they can help. If that doesn't work then return it.

I came from AT&T. I got tired of being on a plan, so I went from a package with AT&T to a pay-as-you-go with AT&T. When rates started inching up and my bill cost more, it was time for me to switch. I stumbled upon Net10. They had flip phones, carry over minutes and cost effective pay-as-you-go. I ordered the phone plus accessories. It arrived quickly!

Other than that, if you are in to fancy phones and you're a HEAVY phone user, Net10 may not be for you. They have 2 pay plans $15(150 minutes) and $25 per month(250 minutes)none are roll over. Then there is the pay-as-you-go (with roll over minutes). They don't carry iphones and their phones are approx. 2 years behind the lastest and greatest.

I bought my first Galaxy s7 a month ago. Just in time for graduations and summer travel. I LOVE the camera on this phone. It is amazing how much better it is than on the Motorolas. But I admit that I do miss my old Motorola batteries. I find I have to charge my Galaxy before the end of the day most days. And it's not like I'm on my phone all day. The fact that it drains so quickly so early in the game worries me. I got my daughter an S7 too with the buy one/get one deal they had. Hers has the same problem. We got portable battery chargers and now keep those charged and travel with them everywhere which is a drag. Still, I knew I was giving up battery life for camera when I moved to the Galaxy, so it's the deal I expected. Updated July 2016 - We've had our S7s for a couple of months now, and I'm finding I don't have to recharge it as much.

samsung,"So far, really good! Amazing bargain at $10. This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.) Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device). My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that. My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I've ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that. So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it's very hard to see what's on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it's a bit of a drag. Not the phone's fault. Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it's sitting on your desk, it doesn't lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you're in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or ""ok"" button, which seems the more common configuration. Haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.",2013-08-07,positive,5,en,far really good amazing bargain third net phone first two att phones lots like att southwest ct imho made sure verizon g end name indicates att c means verizon important functionality good coverage verizon good voice commands reliable bluetooth decent texting ability bad device first phone samsung tg slider really beat fakeberry style phone texting phone voice dialing bluetooth fully functional scratch second phone samsung rg att looked much like phone actually heftier nicer casing kind minitrack pad moving cursor looked like paid rather phone bluetooth weirdest ive ever encountered wrote review amazon time hit space bar texting equally likely get period would get sentences like scratch rc get verizon connectivity normal fullyfunctional bluetooth ability text relatively easily actually find typing fakeberry much easier would thought worst overlays punctuation things like etc started losing fine eyesight murder hard see whats key suppose life phone get used common things use phone new bit drag phones fault unlike phones exposed buttons like rg phone lock every time goes dark feature actually like easily lock hold space bar putting purse sitting desk doesnt lock every time goes dormant great youre midst somewhat sporadic text exchange somewhat unusually unlock phone press soft key space bar rather center ok button seems common configuration havent long enough comment battery life seems better terrible battery life,2,2

samsung,"Samsung Galaxy S3.5 Might be More Appropriate. I'll start off giving a bit of background on my smartphone usage. I've pretty much been a Droid user for my whole life. I'm definitely a power user and I greatly enjoyed having a keyboard. I could type long text messages or emails with ease, and I never really had that much interest in switching to a non-keyboard phone. Unfortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands somewhat. I have the Droid 4 which I greatly enjoy, but it has it's own problems. After having it for about a year it got a pretty nasty crack on it. I played around with some friends GS3's and was very impressed with them. However the rumors about the GS 4 coming out had already started so I decided to hold off. I'm glad that I did, but a lot of my review will be based off of not having the GS3 and making such a drastic switch. As I put in the title, it seems to be minor improvements upon a design they've found worked as opposed to the drastic changes previously seen. Without further ado... The Looks: There isn't much positive to be said about the aesthetics of the Galaxy S4 body to be honest. It looks and feels like a cheap toy. It feels... clammy might be the best way to describe it. It really isn't the best feel when you're holding it, and compared to the HTC One it's disappointing. It doesn't seem like it had that much effort put into changing it. It does feel sturdy though, despite being a very thin phone. I was able to get a good grip on it though which is important to me since I'm rather small. Overall I would give the looks a 2.5/5 The Hardware: Huge upgrade over.. well anything but a computer. This really is just a small computer, and it runs flawlessly. The screen is massive and great. Easily the best one that I've seen on a phone. The 5"" screen could be a little bit big for some people I think, but for most of the younger generation will be ok with it though. The battery is incredible as well. My Droid 4 would die around 4 or so after a normal days use (streaming music, internet, tons of emails, etc). This will last me all day, including going out at night which is a massive incentive to me. The camera is great on it as well, much better than any other Android phone. It is still slightly edged out by the iPhone though. Overall though I would give it a 5/5 on hardware The Software: I'll start with the obvious, it's actually running the latest version of Jelly Bean, and should keep up better than other phones do (minus Nexus 4.) This is a huge bonus, because Android's because fault is that the OS is so fragmented. Now, Samsung has put a ton of their own software on top of Jelly Bean. The best description would be that it's overwhelming probably. There are a lot of Samsung apps that really will just never be used. So I'm not even going to bother going over the party trick type apps. Instead I'll talk about a few that really caught my attention. S Health: Helpful now, will be awesome in the future. The premise is that it's a basically a fitbit built into your phone. It helps you track calories, steps walked, workouts, etc. It works great now, but I don't think that it will get better with accessories. WatchON: Basically it acts as a universal TV remote and a Netflix browser. It's great, and I don't even watch very much TV. I suspect that this will become the standard soon, but until then this is the best version you can get. Air View/Gesture: A great idea, but not great in practice. It's glitchy currently and doesn't always work (or does work in ways that you don't want it to.) Camera Software: There's actually a lot of really great features that come with the camera. The most novel of them is the ability to take a picture from the front and back cameras at the same time. I can see this actually becoming standard in the future as well. Overall I think that the software is good, but not perfect. Overall I would still rather just have stock jelly bean. Samsung adds some good features, but it also adds a lot of stuff that I really don't need and can't get rid of. Final Impressions: It's a good phone, there's no doubt about that. It's not a great phone though. The screen is amazing, the body isn't. The software is good, the hardware is out of this world. It all comes down to personal preference between this and the HTC One I think. Personally I'm fine just putting a case on my GS 4, but I've always been more interested in battery and hardware. I can completely understand picking a slight downgrade on those areas though in return for a great body like the HTC One has. 4/5",2013-04-29,positive,4,en,samsung galaxy might appropriate ill start giving bit background smartphone usage ive pretty much droid user whole life im definitely power user greatly enjoyed keyboard could type long text messages emails ease never really much interest switching nonkeyboard phone unfortunately decision taken hands somewhat droid greatly enjoy problems year got pretty nasty crack played around friends gss impressed however rumors gs coming already started decided hold im glad lot review based gs making drastic switch put title seems minor improvements upon design theyve found worked opposed drastic changes previously seen without ado looks isnt much positive said aesthetics galaxy body honest looks feels like cheap toy feels clammy might best way describe really isnt best feel youre holding compared htc one disappointing doesnt seem like much effort put changing feel sturdy though despite thin phone able get good grip though important since im rather small overall would give looks hardware huge upgrade well anything computer really small computer runs flawlessly screen massive great easily best one ive seen phone screen could little bit big people think younger generation ok though battery incredible well droid would die around normal days use streaming music internet tons emails etc last day including going night massive incentive camera great well much better android phone still slightly edged iphone though overall though would give hardware software ill start obvious actually running latest version jelly bean keep better phones minus nexus huge bonus androids fault os fragmented samsung put ton software top jelly bean best description would overwhelming probably lot samsung apps really never used im even going bother going party trick type apps instead ill talk really caught attention health helpful awesome future premise basically fitbit built phone helps track calories steps walked workouts etc works great dont think get better accessories watchon basically acts universal tv remote netflix browser great dont even watch much tv suspect become standard soon best version get air viewgesture great idea great practice glitchy currently doesnt always work work ways dont want camera software theres actually lot really great features come camera novel ability take picture front back cameras time see actually becoming standard future well overall think software good perfect overall would still rather stock jelly bean samsung adds good features also adds lot stuff really dont need cant get rid final impressions good phone theres doubt great phone though screen amazing body isnt software good hardware world comes personal preference htc one think personally im fine putting case gs ive always interested battery hardware completely understand picking slight downgrade areas though return great body like htc one,2,2

samsung,"Worth buying and trusting!. Okay... at first I was hesitant to buy such phone online because I always want to see any gadget I'm buying personally. Plus, this is the first refurbished phone I bought. Anyway, the phone arrived early and it was in a white box that I first thought was my phone case order. I didn't expect it to be the phone. It was inside a bubble wrap packet along with a generic charger and key pin for the sim card. 1. The phone was in good condition: clean, scratch free, and with a small sticker on top saying ""Qualcommm 4G."" 2. The buttons are funtional: volume, power button and Bixby button working too. 3. Last update from system showed December 2018, so I updated it and it worked. From 8.0, my software is now 9.0 Android Pie. I liked how Samsung made it simple to navigate the phone features with the new update. (Well, it works for me) 4. Samsung account working. Bixby working. 5. Health sensor at the back is functional. Fingerprint scanning too! I tried both ð 6. Camera is really nice! Works like brand new! ð¤© 7. Charging time took me like 2-3hrs to full battery. Using LTE and sometimes wifi with hotspot, it lasted a day for me.. I also tested it on my game, YouTube, and browsing just to observe the battery life span and so far so good. Bottomline, this unlocked s8 met my expectations.. or should I say more! I love it! It's like brand new phone! No regrets buying from this seller. I had 3 choices and reading reviews multiple times gave me anxiety rather than helping me decide LOL, but one review helped me and I'm glad I've decided to choose this seller.

samsung,"The Good, The Bad and Beyond.... The good: - Stunning display. Impressive 5.5 quad -HD screen shows crisp colors from various angles. Best screen on any smart phone. - Beautiful curved design is an eye-candy. - Camera is not 12 megapixels and superior to S6 and iPhone. Auto-focus is also has great speed leaving others in dust. - Large 3600mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day. - Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone. Again, the battery is so good. - Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1mt deep and 30 minutes. - Micro SD expandable memory The Bad (not so much though): - Not removable battery pack. But 3600mAh is plenty. You can watch a full season of Breaking Bad with a single charge. - No USB-C so it's not future proof, but then again the lifetime of the phone is 1-2 years. - Only 32GB version available in US. But you can overcome this with micro-SD storage. Overall this phone makes me smile. It looks stunning, feels good in hand, performs fast, packed with tons of goodies and battery lasts long time. I would still definitely pair it with a phone case though to add grip and provide some protection against scratches and drops. I've ordered a bunch of cases and my favorites areÂ Galaxy S7 Edge Case, LUVVITT [ClearView] Hybrid Scratch Resistant Back Cover with Shock Absorbing Bumper for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge - ClearÂ for a crystal clear slim protection andÂ Galaxy S7 Edge Case, LUVVITT [Ultra Armor] Shock Absorbing Case Best Heavy Duty Dual Layer Tough Cover for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge - Gunmetal / BlackÂ for sleek looking Armor style protection.

samsung,"Compared to ios it feels clunky, but dam* there is so much more you can do with the interface! Love it!. After shattering my iPhone SE 16GB, this is what I chose as a replacement. Missing luxuries from my previous phone: NFC, I really used NFC whenever I would forget my wallet, and often found myself seeking out stores who used this pay method. This phone does not have that. A fingerprint scanner is also missing. The DPI is almost 100 DPI less than the iPhone SE, however, watching movies on this Perx is still delightful, especially with the larger, wide screen. While it is not a crispy over saturated AMOLED screen, it is still HD, and at times I find mysel grabbing this phone, with its powerful battery, over my Samsung S2 8"" powerhouse & whimpy battery. My poor little iPhone SE only had 16gb of space. This Perx only has 16gb, and only ten of those are available. Yet, becasue of the SD Card slot, I can expand up to 128GB, perhpas more. A cavet here is that the, forced on you - Amazon apps are bonded to the internal memory which is quite annoying because I would like to put them on the external memory and relinquish space. This is not a problem on my Samsung Tablet, but it is on this phone. The CPU on this thing is obviously powerful. However, it could use more RAM. I find that i use multiple apps, for texting, photo editing, social media and a nice launcher (NOVA). I am not sure if this is the cause for the sudden and unpredictable mollases speed. Seriously I go from spritely and quick to mired down and stuck. I am tempted to go back to factory settings and slowly download my essential apps, until I start experiencing that lag. I have a feelingly I'll find a sweet spot and compromise. This same scenario occured with my Amazon Tablet which had a paltry 1.5 gb of running memory. I had to cut it down until it ran smoothly . For the money this is an exceptional mid range phone. This will run games well, but you don't want to run a horde of apps in the back ground. With Android, it's about balance. So this is my first time has with Android after about two years. Android is far more manipulatable. The iPhone always have a silky performance. Am i unhappy with this phone? Not in the least.

samsung,"Just say no to Bixby. I have to give this a thumbs down just for one big corporate insult to the consumer that is all about making money over the consumer experience, which corporate calls ""Bixby"": a voice servant far inferior to google voice services (which come free on every android phone) that got a dedicated button, inconveniently placed, so that frequently when you pick up the phone the consumer will inadvertently hit the button and will be asked, for the 100th, 200th or 300th time, 'do you want to set up Bixby?' And there is no way to disable the button. The permissions it requests make clear that this is Samsung's way to farm personal data and make the kind of money Google does from your personal information. Why else go to all the trouble to develop an app that Google perfected long ago and comes free with the phone? I also found that a promotion I was offered to induce me to buy the phone was inordinately difficult to redeem. At the store they told me to go online, once online I was told it could only be done by installing an app on the phone, and the app made it very difficult to redeem the promotion, you have to dig around, and my submission was rejected multiple times, it was really frustrating, I called tech support three times, they said things like ""Please go to the email that rejected your submission, does it say that you were rejected or that you need to resubmit?

samsung,"What Battery Life!. After 6 days, 37% battery remaining; that's pretty amazing! My last phone (Droid Bionic) lasted two days max. Alright, I'm not a really heavy user. I check email a couple of times a day. I make 6-10 phone calls a day. I do some web browsing when away from my desktop computer and run a few apps. OTOH, I'm often connected to wifi (at home or away). Bluetooth is off right now, so that probably saves some juice. What I miss from the Droid was the availability of dedicated docks for car and desk. But it would overheat in the windshield dock, which I'm hoping won't happen with the Note 3. One other negative I've noticed is the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers. I have to be careful to only press the power switch. I'm a 6' tall guy and the size of this is not a problem. I chose it as a way to have a single device rather than carry a tablet in addition to my phone. Carrying it in a pocket of a travel vest is no problem. I think it would be too large to carry on a belt. The camera seems to perform like a phone camera: OK in good light only. At a dimly-lit party with flash on produced smeared images due to excess in-device noise reduction. Love the size for browsing my calendar and email. Web browsing is better than on a phone, but not really competition for a tablet. Just getting accustomed to the S Pen and find it better than a conventional stylus. Have barely scratched the surface of the extra functions. Speaking of just scratching the surface, I find that I'm going to have to set aside time to partake of some tutorials in order to really get the most out of the Note 3. My first smart phone was a Blackberry six years ago, then I graduated to the Droid Bionic. The power of this phone -- plus features of Android 4.3 -- encourage me to learn to live up to what it can do.

samsung,"Good enough if the price is right. I haven't owned a Samsung Galaxy since the S3--my last seven phones have been from Huawei or Xiaomi and before that from One Plus, Essential and Google (Nexus and Pixel). But after several years of using international unlocked phones I wanted to try an Android phone specifically meant for use in the United States again and since One Plus and Pixel phones are ludicrously overpriced Samsung ended up being pretty much the only choice. The good: The Galaxy S10+ features the latest generation Snapdragon 855 processor (in North America, China, and Japan--everybody else gets Samsung's inferior in-house Exynos processor instead) and plenty of RAM so it's fast and powerful. The display is nice, both large and bright with excellent color. On paper, the display supports HDR+ allowing 4K content from Netflix to be viewed with the best color accuracy but when watching movies and television episodes on a 6.4-inch smartphone screen, I'm not sure how anyone can actually tell. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and face unlock are fast (although I didn't test how secure either actually was). The battery is large and should provide even heavy users who do lots of media streaming or gaming with a full day of power on a single charge. Signal strength and call quality are excellent. You even get a headphone jack and a slot for an external memory card, two features you almost never see these days on flagship smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S10+ also runs Android Pie which is currently the latest version of Android. The bad: While Samsung used to have one of the best Android cameras they have fallen behind Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi. The camera on the S10+ is solid and takes good enough pictures but as flagships go it doesn't measure up to the competition--particularly where low light shots are concerned. Samsung has been using the same camera sensor on its Galaxy line since the S7--that's four generations of Galaxy phones without an upgrade. Samsung's current charging technology is almost painfully slow compared with Xiaomi and Huawei--particularly wireless charging which seems to take forever. Bixby which was supposed to be Samsung's alternative to Google Assistant. I don't know even one person with a Samsung phone who actually uses Bixby but there's a dedicated Bixby button on the S10+. Samsung needs to either ditch the Bixby button entirely or make it easier to remap. The Xiaomi assistant button can be remapped to Google or Alexa in seconds. With Samsung you need to download a third-party app from the Play Store, have access to a computer, download ADB tools from Google or another website, enable the hidden Developer Options menu on your phone and allow USB Debugging, connect your phone to the computer, open a command prompt window and then type the necessary ADB commands--otherwise the Bixby button is always mapped to Bixby. The Galaxy S10+ is less comfortable to hold than any phablet I've owned in recent memory--overall the size is virtually identical to the Xiaomi MI 9 but the S10+ feels awkward and the less than ergonomic button placement (power button very high on the right side with Bixby and volume buttons very high on the left) doesn't help. The Galaxy S10+ might be a little on the heavy side thanks to its large battery but a slightly more curved body and better button placement would have gone a long way towards making the S10+ more comfortable in the hand. The speakers are loud-- the S10+ comes with a single bottom-firing speaker and a front-facing earpiece speaker that's also used to create a stereo effect--but they don't really sound very good even with Dolby Atmos to enhance the quality. Samsung is terrible with software updates for its official US unlocked phones--right now it's August and their unlocked S10+ is still on the May security patch. In the US unlocked smartphones account for an extremely small percentage of the market so Samsung focuses their resources on software updates for carrier-branded models. Updates for Samsung's unlocked US phones come months after the carriers get them. The rest: The use of a punch hole in the display for the front-facing cameras (and earpiece speaker?) is something I have mixed feelings about. It does give Samsung bragging rights on paper about a higher screen to body ratio but in practical everyday use, the camera cutout is located far enough from the top of the display that you end up with an unusually thick screen-wasting taskbar when using apps not designed for fullscreen mode--and with fullscreen apps that have a light background the dark oval punchout is at least as distracting as a notch. Samsung uses its own custom skin on top of Android called One UI. The overall software experience isn't bad and there are definitely some useful features that you won't find in stock Android. The problem is that Samsung throws in an over-abundance of features that can't be disabled even if you have no use for them so One UI ends up needlessly draining the battery. With more streamlined software S10+ owners could easily get two full days of normal use without a charge but One UI sucks up way too much power for that to happen. Ultimately the biggest problem with the Galaxy S10+ is price--the Xiaomi MI 9 has the same Snapdragon 855 processor as the S10+, is every bit as fast, charges more quickly, takes better pictures, and offers both face-unlock and an in-screen fingerprint reader and overall build quality superior to phones from Google Pixel and OnePlus. The Xiaomi MI 9 listed for $500 at launch but can currently be purchased for as little as $350 brand new. With the Galaxy S10+, you get a nicer display and bigger battery but is that worth an extra $400-$600? There are two very large problems for smartphone consumers here in the United States: 1) Apple and Samsung have a virtual duopoly in the market here and account for roughly 70% of all phone sales in the United States, giving Apple and Samsung pretty much no incentive to innovate or lower prices. 2) 90% of consumers in the United States purchase phones through their carriers, giving our phone carriers the power to act as the gateway to US customers and eliminate anything resembling free-market competition. In terms of innovation and price, the best Android phones in recent years have come from Xiaomi, Honor, and Huawei but none of those phones are on shelves here in the United States. That's allowed Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus to sell US consumers inferior phones at grossly inflated prices. The Samsung Galaxy S10+ might currently be the best phone on the US market--it has significantly more premium build quality than phones from Google Pixel or Oneplus, itâs fast and powerful, has a big battery, a great display and lots of features. But in a market with better choices paying more than $700 for the Galaxy S10+ would be hard to justify.",2019-08-02,neutral,3,en,good enough price right havent owned samsung galaxy since smy last seven phones huawei xiaomi one plus essential google nexus pixel several years using international unlocked phones wanted try android phone specifically meant use united states since one plus pixel phones ludicrously overpriced samsung ended pretty much choice good galaxy features latest generation snapdragon processor north america china japaneverybody else gets samsungs inferior inhouse exynos processor instead plenty ram fast powerful display nice large bright excellent color paper display supports hdr allowing k content netflix viewed best color accuracy watching movies television episodes inch smartphone screen im sure anyone actually tell ultrasonic fingerprint scanner face unlock fast although didnt test secure either actually battery large provide even heavy users lots media streaming gaming full day power single charge signal strength call quality excellent even get headphone jack slot external memory card two features almost never see days flagship smartphones samsung galaxy also runs android pie currently latest version android bad samsung used one best android cameras fallen behind chinese rivals huawei xiaomi camera solid takes good enough pictures flagships go doesnt measure competitionparticularly low light shots concerned samsung using camera sensor galaxy line since sthats four generations galaxy phones without upgrade samsungs current charging technology almost painfully slow compared xiaomi huaweiparticularly wireless charging seems take forever bixby supposed samsungs alternative google assistant dont know even one person samsung phone actually uses bixby theres dedicated bixby button samsung needs either ditch bixby button entirely make easier remap xiaomi assistant button remapped google alexa seconds samsung need download thirdparty app play store access computer download adb tools google another website enable hidden developer options menu phone allow usb debugging connect phone computer open command prompt window type necessary adb commandsotherwise bixby button always mapped bixby galaxy less comfortable hold phablet ive owned recent memoryoverall size virtually identical xiaomi mi feels awkward less ergonomic button placement power button high right side bixby volume buttons high left doesnt help galaxy might little heavy side thanks large battery slightly curved body better button placement would gone long way towards making comfortable hand speakers loud comes single bottomfiring speaker frontfacing earpiece speaker thats also used create stereo effectbut dont really sound good even dolby atmos enhance quality samsung terrible software updates official us unlocked phonesright august unlocked still may security patch us unlocked smartphones account extremely small percentage market samsung focuses resources software updates carrierbranded models updates samsungs unlocked us phones come months carriers get rest use punch hole display frontfacing cameras earpiece speaker something mixed feelings give samsung bragging rights paper higher screen body ratio practical everyday use camera cutout located far enough top display end unusually thick screenwasting taskbar using apps designed fullscreen modeand fullscreen apps light background dark oval punchout least distracting notch samsung uses custom skin top android called one ui overall software experience isnt bad definitely useful features wont find stock android problem samsung throws overabundance features cant disabled even use one ui ends needlessly draining battery streamlined software owners could easily get two full days normal use without charge one ui sucks way much power happen ultimately biggest problem galaxy pricethe xiaomi mi snapdragon processor every bit fast charges quickly takes better pictures offers faceunlock inscreen fingerprint reader overall build quality superior phones google pixel oneplus xiaomi mi listed launch currently purchased little brand new galaxy get nicer display bigger battery worth extra two large problems smartphone consumers united states apple samsung virtual duopoly market account roughly phone sales united states giving apple samsung pretty much incentive innovate lower prices consumers united states purchase phones carriers giving phone carriers power act gateway us customers eliminate anything resembling freemarket competition terms innovation price best android phones recent years come xiaomi honor huawei none phones shelves united states thats allowed samsung google pixel oneplus sell us consumers inferior phones grossly inflated prices samsung galaxy might currently best phone us marketit significantly premium build quality phones google pixel oneplus itas fast powerful big battery great display lots features market better choices paying galaxy would hard justify,1,2

samsung,"Works great, great product, no problems. The one star reviews had me a bit worried, but i'm glad they didn't sway me away from purchasing the phone. Here's a few things: 1. It is unlocked 2. If in the USA, you might not be able to simply swap in a sim card from an old phone and have it work right away. You'll need to contact your carrier and they'll set it up for you. Metro PCS charged about $16 for this. 3. The phone met the descriptions. 4. It works great and has no problems. Scammers will sometimes order things from amazon and then swap out the item with something else that weighs the same, like replacing items with clay or dirt or rocks, and send it back to Amazon. I think there's some cases where these items appear to have never been opened and get put back into stock only to find it's way to someones home who then has most of these 1 star issues. As for the product itself, it's very nice. Personally, I use an S7 and don't plan on upgrading for at least two or three more years. The s10 is great with it's full faced screen even though there's a dot where the camera is. Get a case. Get a good case. People complain about the screen breaking but if you mishandle your phone it can break like any other phone. Nobody in their right mind would walk around with a $650 device that will break when dropped at waist level if unprotected. Wrap it up. The screen comes with a protector already installed, but do get a case for it that adds protection. You can use a usbc to hdmi cable to connect your phone to different devices. Samsung Dex comes with the phone so you can use it like a portable computer if you want or use screen mirroring via cable. You can also cast your screen to other devices if those devices allow for it (roku/chromecast/etc). The camera is nice, the selfie side does leave a bit to be desired though.

samsung,"standard, average smartphone, with a couple sticking points.. Overall, the phone is not bad, though there are a couple of issues which, if I had known about ahead of time, may have put me off buying it. I have been a loyal Samsung user for my past three phones, and have liked them up to this one. First, there is a lot of bloatware that can't be gotten rid of without rooting and breaking warranties. More frustrating, with this phone Samsung has taken away the ability to turn some of those apps off, even if you can't get rid of them. In my last phone, a Note 2, I could turn off/disable the Samsung calendar. I much prefer Google's calendar app. In this handset, not only can I not turn off the Samsung calendar, it is constantly changing its settings AND Google calendar's.

With that being said, don't expect some Galaxy S7 quality when using this phone, but it is pretty good at holding its own. The one thing that surprised me was that this has a 5MP front camera and a 13MP back camera when the specs on Amazon are a tad different. I bought 2 of these phones, one in white and one in gold. Both have the same features and are used by 2 different people who have no complaints about the phone. Memory is a bit limited on this phone, but a microSD card is supported and I highly recommend grabbing one if you use your phone to store a lot. I currently have it running on Lollipop 5.0.2 but it is has an update pending so it can go a bit more than that. Other unique thing about this phone is that it has a LED flash on both sides of the phone, so all photos will remain bright. In general, I would suggest this phone to someone who is either waiting for the next flagship and needs a temporary phone or for someone who needs the capabilities of a smartphone at a low price. RAM is 1.5GB on the Samsung Galaxy J5 while average smartphone RAM is 2GB and flagship level is 4GB now. It can run a fair amount of processes, but I haven't tried any heavy duty things on the phone.

samsung,"Not enough memory- full to the brim with bloatware. Even with a large SD memory card, this phone quickly ran out of memory, to the point where I can't even update my apps. I've installed far fewer apps than in my previous android phones, and moved every possible app to the card memory, and use the memory card for all my photos, music, and anything else I can. I still have plenty of room on my memory card, and I only use the internal memory when I have no other choice, such as certain critical or unmovable apps, and system functions But even with this minimal use of internal memory, it's full, to the point where my apps can't update, and the phone bugs me every single day to update the android software, but it can't since there's no room to do so. The reason is the phone is filled to the brim with useless bloatware, which you cannot uninstall. I tried to root the phone but it was too late, a small android update blocked that ability. So the phone is crippled to the point of being defective. It's a shame because the hardware is great- the camera and battery life are better than any phone I've ever had, the GPS works well, and the performance overall is great. Why they would ruin all that by putting so little memory in, and filling all of that with bloatware, is beyond me..

samsung,"FYI for Google Play App Users & Verizon Customers. I bought my last Samsung Note 3 from Amazon and at that time, they worked with the carriers, so the phone came ready with the correct SIM card; unfortunately only unlocked phones are sold now. When I tried to activate the phone for Verizon, I kept receiving the message that the phone is not compatible. This didn't make sense to me. I opened the SIM tray and found that no SIM was included, even though it showed 2 IMEI numbers. I checked the description in the ""Amazon Shopping"" Google Play app and it noted in one of the charts that the SIM card was included in the ""What's in the box"" description. However, after calling Amazon and working with about 5 different support folks, it was apparent that this is a typo in the Google app. After looking at the website and thru the Windows app, it was discovered that the description did not include the SIM card. I purchased a Verizon SIM card and still received the message that the phone is not compatible. I called Verizon and they received the same message, then I went into a Verizon store, since another reviewer described having the same issue. Between all of us, the IMEI number must have been scanned and manually input 30 times. It never worked for me. Then I got the hard sell in the store and bought it there, since they could make sure the phone was compatible. I left with all of this extra ""free"" stuff and still think I was a sucker, because I can't make the math work that it equaled Amazon's price. I also walked out with a free Samsung tablet, which I didn't need, along with it also being setup for wireless, which I'll never use. That is why I love Amazon, I am a pushover to sales folks. It may not seem it, but I am very tech savvy, but I relied on the description and overrode common sense. I also read all of the reviews but didn't notice anyone saying the SIM was not included, but Amazon support pointed out a few. So, beware of the description in the Google app and don't be stupid, like I was; if the choice is phone only and it's unlocked, then a SIM is not included... duh. Plus, sometimes the phone really is not compatible. Amazon support was very pleasant and did not stop until they found the tech able to figure out what went wrong. She even submitted an alert to the Google Play store regarding the misleading description. Otherwise, I think I'll like the phone itself. The battery is greatly improved! It is longer than the Note 3 by about an inch, but I'm not sure if that's a plus, yet.",2018-11-26,positive,4,en,fyi google play app users verizon customers bought last samsung note amazon time worked carriers phone came ready correct sim card unfortunately unlocked phones sold tried activate phone verizon kept receiving message phone compatible didnt make sense opened sim tray found sim included even though showed imei numbers checked description amazon shopping google play app noted one charts sim card included whats box description however calling amazon working different support folks apparent typo google app looking website thru windows app discovered description include sim card purchased verizon sim card still received message phone compatible called verizon received message went verizon store since another reviewer described issue us imei number must scanned manually input times never worked got hard sell store bought since could make sure phone compatible left extra free stuff still think sucker cant make math work equaled amazons price also walked free samsung tablet didnt need along also setup wireless ill never use love amazon pushover sales folks may seem tech savvy relied description overrode common sense also read reviews didnt notice anyone saying sim included amazon support pointed beware description google app dont stupid like choice phone unlocked sim included duh plus sometimes phone really compatible amazon support pleasant stop found tech able figure went wrong even submitted alert google play store regarding misleading description otherwise think ill like phone battery greatly improved longer note inch im sure thats plus yet,2,1

samsung,"Very Nice capabilities and very future proof. Finally after years of waiting, a phone with practically everything that I want and need seems to be here. I've had this phone for over 2 months and it has a Large and high quality display yet easy to hold in one hand, powerful (future proof), long battery life, good sound quality and clarity on both speakers, Infrared TV remote, good camera, USB 3.0 speeds, support for latest wireless standards and optional SD card. I hope bug/performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my Verizon GNexus. Might need to be patient and give the phone a few daysâI got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50% after 9 hours of usage and I was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much, but it improved over time. The 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80% after the same usage and only dropped 2% or 3% overnight instead of 4% to 6% like with the current one. Positives: Battery Life Charge Times Screen Size Sound Quality of both speakers -- so nice not to hear chipmunks anymore Signal Quality (wifi and LTE) Camera Quality in decent lighting Phone stays cool during heavy usage (gaming, phone calls, etc) Overall Keyboard Layout Negatives: Intermittent unexplained battery drainageâMaybe NSA is spying on me? :) Auto-corrections on native keyboard The way that the Phone and Contacts features workâshould be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left-handed people with large hands Intermittent TouchWiz feature malfunctions (s voice, gestures, 1 handed mode, etc) Inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety--I only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter (not earphones) since I don't have Bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car. Some Notes: TouchWiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice, but Iâve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every-day use. I only have prior experience with Native android and Cyanogenmod and although I prefer TouchWiz over Native android, it still needs some serious work. For instance, I find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as Smart Stay, S Voice, Hand Gestures, etc, so Iâve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home. It is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using TouchWiz Battery Life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since I got my replacement Note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st oneâgoing to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of OS malfunction. With normal drainage I can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what I consider moderate usage (Hangouts chatting, phone calls, iHeartRadio, gaming, and watching videos). Considering that I have a larger screen than I had before, use more of the phoneâs features and for longer periods of time while running TouchWiz; Iâm impressed. The battery is not even 2x the capacity of my GNexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on Native android or Cyanogenmod. The screen is fantastic and Iâve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problemsânative player can handle most video formats, but does NOT have the same support for audio encoding. Phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, the materials feel kind of cheap so Iâve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics. Things that I donât like: I currently know 2 other people whoâve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements. My 1st one had issues with USB3.0 connectivity, a faulty charging cable, strange tapping sound during phone calls, and a few other bugs. The other party had issues with the charging portânot sure if the 3rd person had issues. My friend that always buys Samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common, but this is only my 2nd Samsung phone so I cannot say for sure if this is the case. Auto-correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural. Iâm used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what I initially typed in the event that auto-correct is not needed, but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the Sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto-correctionsâthis is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself. Should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone. Hopefully Apple hasn't patented this feature. As with my Galaxy Nexus, the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use. Not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a-lot while using their phones. Stylus is hard to removeâgood that it wonât fall out on accident though. Surprisingly, it has not damaged any of my nails. Interestingly, my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy--You go Cimo S-Line Case In order to use USB 3.0, it has to switch to airplane mode--transfers donât last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on USB 2.0 mode if 5 minutes go by and USB 3.0 is not being used. This feature can also be problematic if you try to let Windows Convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes. Wall charger has USB port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of Surge suppressors.",2014-02-14,positive,5,en,nice capabilities future proof finally years waiting phone practically everything want need seems ive phone months large high quality display yet easy hold one hand powerful future proof long battery life good sound quality clarity speakers infrared tv remote good camera usb speeds support latest wireless standards optional sd card hope bugperformance fixes get released timely manner unlike verizon gnexus might need patient give phone daysai got replacement st charges battery would drain easily hours usage even using amount features st phone even using much improved time st phone issue right box would dropped usage dropped overnight instead like current one positives battery life charge times screen size sound quality speakers nice hear chipmunks anymore signal quality wifi lte camera quality decent lighting phone stays cool heavy usage gaming phone calls etc overall keyboard layout negatives intermittent unexplained battery drainageamaybe nsa spying autocorrections native keyboard way phone contacts features workashould simpler use screen size requires hands might suited lefthanded people large hands intermittent touchwiz feature malfunctions voice gestures handed mode etc inability remember audio settings head set constant prompts volume safetyi use audio jack car connected cassette adapter earphones since dont bluetooth native support smart phones car notes touchwiz adds much needed functionality native android nice iave turned lot features overkill needs unreliable everyday use prior experience native android cyanogenmod although prefer touchwiz native android still needs serious work instance find swipe left right message call contact works intermittently along advertised features smart stay voice hand gestures etc iave turned enable using hands free mode driving home also difficult basic tasks using touchwiz battery life charge times stock charger nice although times since got replacement note seems like something drains battery much faster st oneagoing eventually reset phone see kind os malfunction normal drainage usually go days single charge consider moderate usage hangouts chatting phone calls iheartradio gaming watching videos considering larger screen use phoneas features longer periods time running touchwiz iam impressed battery even x capacity gnexus would required charges daily kind usage native android cyanogenmod screen fantastic iave enjoyed watching p p videos without problemsanative player handle video formats support audio encoding phone feels light weight although aesthetically pleasing look materials feel kind cheap iave invested cheap case prolong aesthetics things donat like currently know people whoave bought phone along get replacements st one issues usb connectivity faulty charging cable strange tapping sound phone calls bugs party issues charging portanot sure rd person issues friend always buys samsung phones says issues charging ports common nd samsung phone cannot say sure case autocorrect word suggestions native keyboard pain use unnatural iam used pressing back key words reset initially typed event autocorrect needed keyboard sometimes presented undo button sometimes get creative use sym button write stylus pen bypass autocorrectionsathis major flaw opinion fixed considering several updates released apps phone take much effort type touch screen phone hopefully apple hasnt patented feature galaxy nexus auto screen brightness dim standard use sure well would prolong battery life walk around alot using phones stylus hard removeagood wonat fall accident though surprisingly damaged nails interestingly protection case makes removing stylus easyyou go cimo sline case order use usb switch airplane modetransfers donat last long speeds anyway built feature turn back usb mode minutes go usb used feature also problematic try let windows convert video file transferred phone would take minutes wall charger usb port side wall unit invite bent prongs considering recommended remove save power wastes port lot surge suppressors,2,2
samsung,The best phone I've ever owned.. I was skeptic about buying this because I wasn't sure it would work with my phone plan (Ihave boost mobile). Plus the phone was used and I was worried about what condition it would actually be in once I've gotten it. Once I received the phone it looked brand new not 1 scratch on it. Boost couldn't activate it though so I became a little discouraged. The girl that worked at boost told me I could go to sprint and they would help me for a fee. I went to sprint to get the sims card that boost does not carry on hand. They would have had to order it. So I went to sprint gave them the info on the sim card I needed. They were able to help me and the sims card ended up being free. Setup was easy after that. I just needed to put my info into the phone and less then 5 minutes it was up and running. I love that the phone came with a warranty. I purchased the phone October 2018 and I called samsung to find out how much longer the warranty was good for. They told me August of next year.

This phone is practical, light weight, fast as can be, easy to use. The size may be a bit unnerving to begin with but I find it very comfortable it the hand.

But being able to go with a big android with a stable system, easily comparable photo quality, the 2-app thing this was a no-brainer. The great battery life and the speed with data are added bonuses.

samsung,Phone received appears to not be a US phone. I received my phone a few days ago and ran out to Verizon to get it activated. Subsequent to activation and account setup with Verizon I found that I have not been able to send images through Messages to my friends. This manifests with my getting an invalid number error but text goes through fine. Another oddity: the Microsoft office apps installed (those are installed by default??) are in a folder that is in Spanish and despite language being changed they are still in Spanish. I had a few warning signs that indicated the problem but I am just putting it altogether now: 1. When the phone was turned on the default language was Spanish and i'm in the US and expected the default to be English. 2. Verizon was not able to find the IMEI number in their database 3. Samsung's website isn't able to find the IMEI or serial number when I go to register it. I'm trying to get support and though registering was the first place to start. The Samsung site only has a listing of US phones\ 4. I can't find the APN menu. To solve the MMS issue I wanted to check the APNs but that function doesn't exist in mobile networks. I don't know if this is a Verizon thing or something with the phone. It seems peculiar though. 5. The final bit is I looked at the warranty card and it is all in Spanish as well. The contact details provided are for Costa Rica and the Caribbean I've called Amazon who is an authorized retailer for Samsung and they are sending me a replacement. I've asked if the phone can be verified prior to sending it to me but if they opened the box it would invalidate the warranty. We'll see what happens. Phone Thoughts: I've been using the phone for a few days now and overall the device seems pretty good. Battery life is very good and the phone is very fast. The only concern I'm having is the camera. I've taken a bunch of pictures and i'm a bit underwhelmed. I haven't taken the time to really dive into it yet and most of my pictures have been in low light/poor light. I'll need to experiment a bit more but at first pass this may be a weakness for the phone.,2019-01-01,negative,1,en,phone received appears us phone received phone days ago ran verizon get activated subsequent activation account setup verizon found able send images messages friends manifests getting invalid number error text goes fine another oddity microsoft office apps installed installed default folder spanish despite language changed still spanish warning signs indicated problem putting altogether phone turned default language spanish im us expected default english verizon able find imei number database samsungs website isnt able find imei serial number go register im trying get support though registering first place start samsung site listing us phones cant find apn menu solve mms issue wanted check apns function doesnt exist mobile networks dont know verizon thing something phone seems peculiar though final bit looked warranty card spanish well contact details provided costa rica caribbean ive called amazon authorized retailer samsung sending replacement ive asked phone verified prior sending opened box would invalidate warranty well see happens phone thoughts ive using phone days overall device seems pretty good battery life good phone fast concern im camera ive taken bunch pictures im bit underwhelmed havent taken time really dive yet pictures low lightpoor light ill need experiment bit first pass may weakness phone,0,0

I followed all prompts on the box to activate the phone and none of them worked I even paid the plan for the month because that ""supposedly"" would activate the phone (which didn't) instead it gave me a # with the last 4 digits missing from it so I don't even know the # to the phone. I called Verizon's customer service and couldn't get through to no one. The automated system kept asking for different #'s on the box which I couldn't give because labels had been placed over all of the information on the box. When I finally got through the representatives kept giving me #'s for the prepaid department that didn't work so finally I decided to go to the corporate Verizon store to find out apparently the sim card that comes with the phone wasn't the right one so the store had to call customer care to get another one sent out (still waiting...) phone overall isn't bad but the Camera quality isn't good.

samsung,"So far so good. I have always been cheap when it comes to phones as I don't really use them much. I had a refurb Samsung Core Galaxy Prime which worked ok for my needs but using Google Maps would freeze up or lag a lot and some apps will no longer work with the older android. I wanted something faster for GPS as well as something that supported wifi calling. I decided to go with a refurb as I had good luck last time and I ended up with the Galaxy S7 Edge. I was going to buy something cheaper like the J7 and I probably would've been fine with that but hopefully this one is fast enough to warrant the upgrade. I bought a tracfone byop sim kit and called tracfone and transferred my number to the new phone. Unfortunately I found out that wifi calling doesn't work with most prepaid services (in my case I'm using cdma/verizon through tracfone). I need to buy a real verizon plan to use it apparently as the option is not listed in the phone options where it should be. I don't use many minutes in a month so it's cheaper to just go prepaid. While the screen looks good, I think the curved edge is a really dumb design. I don't know why they thought this was useful somehow...it just makes things hard to read when a letter happens to land right on the curve. I also feel like the screen protectors may not be as effective since it can't cover all 4 sides to the edge. I wish I had put more thought into that before purchasing it, I see absolutely no advantage to the curve. Size-wise it's actually a little too big for my tastes. I don't really get the desire for ultra-thin phones, it just makes it harder to hold onto. My old phone was held easily but this one is a bit awkward because of the height. In this case bigger is not better but I will just live with it rather than go through the return hassles. So far I'm not impressed by the battery life but that's very possibly due to all the updates going on for the first day or two. I don't think the fast charging is working with the supplied wall charger/usb cable, supposedly it's supposed to tell me when that's working? It seems to charge slower than my old phone. I will update when I've used it more and can gauge it better. Over I gave it 4 stars pending my updates based on the value since it's a refurb. The screen was in fine condition, no real wear on it. P.S. The seller says as a ""gift"" they put on a screen protector but it's REALLY bad. I seriously thought there was something wrong with the touchscreen when first using it because I had to press so hard to get buttons to respond, especially near the edge. It was extra annoying because I had to then clean off the sticky crap around the edges that the screen protector was held on with before I could put on a real tempered-glass protector that works. A good one cost me $10 and now the touchscreen works perfect. The seller needs to stop being cheap or not put a protector on at all. Edit: I have been getting very poor signal from Verizon so I tried to switch to a T-Mobile sim card and tracfone says it is not compatible with this phone and that it is locked to Verizon. I paid for an UNLOCKED phone that supposedly also supports GSM...now I can barely even receive calls and have no option to change carriers.

samsung,"What flip phones used to be. Just to be up front, I did not purchase this phone through Amazon, but directly from Verizon. I'm ""old school"", and didn't want a ""smart"" phone, (or the extra $30 a month for a Data Plan). After watching it for weeks, it finally went on sale for $0 with a new contract, so I jumped on it. After putting up with total cheap-O phones and poor cell service from T-Mobile Prepaid, I needed a new phone and carrier, so the Verizon deal was perfect. On to the Samsung Convoy 3... I've only had the phone since December 2nd, so this is a preliminary review of what I've found so far. I'll update it after I've had it longer. Thought I'd get my first impression out for folks like me who are need a new flip phone, but are having trouble finding many reviews of the Convoy 3. I never owned the two previous Convoys, so I can't compare. But from complaints about ""pocket texting"" and other inadvertent pushes of the outside buttons when carried in a pants pocket, the new Convoy 3 front button Lock is a big improvement. I have carried it in my pocket and have not had a problem walking around, or when pulling it out. BTW, this thing is pretty BIG for a flip phone, but still seems OK to carry in a pants pocket all day. Coming from a bottom of the line LG and Samsung pre-paid phone, the Convoy 3 is a MUCH nicer phone. It's well constructed and feels solid. Is it Military Grade tough? I doubt it. I don't find it any more solid than my wife's LG Accolade, but always thought her phone was a good quality device, much better than the newer Revere2 or Samsung Gusto that's available now. Manufacturers are putting most of the R & D, and quality design dollars into ""smart phones"" now, so finding a good flip phone nowadays is tough. The only other phone I considered was the LG Exalt, but didn't like the form factor and keys seemed cheapo. Many reviews s far rate the voice quality as very good, but I never had the chance to try it for comparison. The main screen is nice, with good resolution and clarity. The one brief time I tried it in the sun, it washed out, but I didn't expect it to stay that legible...remember it's not a Galaxy where the screen is everything ;-). The outer screen is small and a little cramped when using the shortcuts, but because the resolution is good, everything is legible. I like the outer screen and buttons being able to navigate some of the phone's functions when it's closed. Other things I really like is the customization options that were sorely lacking on my two previous crummy phones. I can't compare it to anything but my wife's LG, but seems like it has a few more bells and whistles. I don't use her phone, so maybe not the most informed opinion ;-). There is a lot I have to learn about the Convoy's menus and all the options available, but so far it seems pretty complete. I don't text, use the wireless web, or Bluetooth, so I can't comment on those features. Also, I haven't used the camera/video cam, so no idea of the quality of either. I will update those over time. As others have mentioned, the flashlight is great! Very bright, nicely defused light. I can see loving it in a pinch now that it's getting dark so early. I can't comment yet on coverage. I live in San Francisco, and so far I haven't had any issues. I will update as time goes on. As far as Voice Quality, I am just a tad disappointed it wasn't better. When I've talked to my wife on her Verizon cell, it sounded very much like we were on cell phones...clear and understandable, but slightly distorted. I have since turned down the volume and will see if that helps. Besides initial voice quality impressions, I had a couple other disappointments...I carry the phone in my pants pocket, so wanted something with a strong vibrate and loud ring. The convoy has neither. With one of the default ring tones, turned up to max, I still have a little difficulty hearing it if the speakers are facing my leg, and the vibrate isn't strong enough to help out. I'll update this too if I find another ring tone that's louder. This is my First Impression review, and I will update it after I've lived with my Convoy 3 for a while as I'm sure I will have more informed opinions about it then. 1-18-14 Update: Here are a few things I've noticed about the Convoy 3 since I've had it a while... 1. Announces Caller I.D. via speaker before phone rings. A little difficult to understand who it is when it's in a pocket, but nice feature if it's not. 2. Flashlight is really handy! When you activate it from the outside buttons, it only stays on a short time, but when activated with the phone open, it stays on. Just don't shine it in a friend's eyes ;-). 3. Photos taken in good light are really quite decent. Low light is more a challenge (not so great for sunsets when a flash won't help). Bluetooth transfer works fine. 4. Speaker phone function works with phone closed...yeay! Answer an incoming call by holding down the right spine Speaker button, and a start talking. No need to open the phone. The speaker has as much volume as I've needed so far. 5. If you want to check time, battery level, or whatever the outer display info shows, simply hit one of the outer buttons and it wakes up. Old flip without outer buttons had to be opened to view missed calls, battery level, etc. You have to unlock the buttons to use the menu, but for a quick glance at info, it's a nice touch. 6. No pocket texting, or any volume level changes, etc., from accidental button pushes. 7. Battery life is good...I may talk 15 minutes max a day, very few photos, flashlight or speaker use per week (give or take), and I've been getting around a week between charges. 8. I don't text much, but font size could be a touch larger. I can still read it without glasses though. 9. Missed call reminder ringtone is nice, and programmable. 10. Vibrate mode is almost too weak to be useable in a pocket. WTF? A ""rugged"" phone with a wimpy vibrate mode? C'mon Samsung! 11. Wakeup delay of a couple seconds when opening the phone to make a call makes me wonder if it's on or not. 5-8-14 Update: A couple things I've noticed that are more negative :-(. 1. Tone of speaker is too warm or muddy, at least for me. I wish there was a Tone control to add treble. I'm sure my years of listing to Rock music at too high of levels has killed my sensitivity to higher frequencies (my mom told me this would happen!), but I find my wife's older LG Accolade has clearer call quality. 2. Coverage could be better. Again, compared to the wife's Accolade, the Samsung Convoy 3 loses signal easier - not a lot, but occasionally it drops a call in a spot the LG wouldn't. 3. I've been texting more, and the fonts really need one size larger. Seems like Samsung could address this with a software update, but I'm not holding my breath :-(. 4. A lot of difficulty getting the thing to connect to my computer via USB to download video or multiple photos - picking out a bunch of photos on the small screen is tedious to do via Bluetooth. A couple positives :-) 1.Outdoors in good light, the camera is pretty good for a flip phone. You won't confuse the photos with those taken with a smartphone or good digital camera, but now I don't miss my Canon Elph QUITE as much or always feel the need to drag my regular camera around to grab a quick photo. 2. Speakerphone is nice and loud, and to me, a little clearer than the regular handset speaker (as long as the volume isn't cranked up TOO high). 3. Using a Micro SD card alleviates the issue of cumbersome transferring of files via Blue Tooth.

How is it fair for a person who has been a loyal customer for years and is eligible for an upgrade to pay $70 more for a phone than someone who is new. I am even upgrading a non-smart phone to the smart phone and they will be getting the smart phone tax every month on my bill.

samsung,"A Decent Phone On Paper That's Riddled With Bugs & Hiccups. First A Warning - Even after a major update designed to fix the fingerprint sensor, this phone still has less than a 50% success rate which is frankly unacceptable. I had the phone paired with my FitBit so most of the times I didn't need to unlock my phone which would give me a false sense of hope. I use a password manager that requires a fingerprint to authenticate, and trying to use that was a disaster. In the end, this is the main reason I'll most likely be returning the phone. Performance wise, this phone is punching above it's weight class. I was able to play PUBG with no issues (lowest settings) and could have probably bumped up the settings to be honest. At this price point, playing demanding games like PUBG isn't a given and is very much an achievement that should be noted. Aside from that glaring issue, most day to day use of the phone is genuinely pleasant and you can forget that this is a sub $300 phone (if you get the international version like this one with no warranty). Most apps are snappy, and the cameras aren't half bad. I've had an odd issue with the GPS going out every 5 minutes during a 1 hour drive this past weekend that was annoying, but that might be a defect in my device specifically as I haven't seen others complain about it. Overall, aside from the barely usable fingerprint scanner, this fantastic. If I didn't need the fingerprint scanner for my password manager, I'd absolutely keep it, and getting an in-screen fingerprint sensor at this price range is very nice!",2019-10-27,positive,4,en,decent phone paper thats riddled bugs hiccups first warning even major update designed fix fingerprint sensor phone still less success rate frankly unacceptable phone paired fitbit times didnt need unlock phone would give false sense hope use password manager requires fingerprint authenticate trying use disaster end main reason ill likely returning phone performance wise phone punching weight class able play pubg issues lowest settings could probably bumped settings honest price point playing demanding games like pubg isnt given much achievement noted aside glaring issue day day use phone genuinely pleasant forget sub phone get international version like one warranty apps snappy cameras arent half bad ive odd issue gps going every minutes hour drive past weekend annoying might defect device specifically havent seen others complain overall aside barely usable fingerprint scanner fantastic didnt need fingerprint scanner password manager id absolutely keep getting inscreen fingerprint sensor price range nice,2,0

samsung,"You need this big beautiful screen and so many other features. I've been a Samsung Galaxy owner for quite a few years now. I even owned a Note 4 which I liked very much. I just upgraded from the Galaxy S8+ and have had this phone for about a week. I love it. The phone feels good in my hand; obviously I like large screen phones. It's powerful, the screen is crystal clear and the camera is excellent to say the least. Since I've only had the phone for a short time I have been playing with it quite a bit, setting it up and adding and using old and new apps. So the battery life I have found to be, still, pretty damn good. I expect that when I start to use it more normally as I have in the past that the battery life on this will exceed pretty much any phone that I've ever had before. One other point. In the past I never really used the Note stylus very much. However, one of the selling points on this model is how functional the stylus has become. I've used it for to take selfies and I love that I can copy text and photos from websites that don't allow you normally (I'm looking at you Instagram!) to copy and paste. And that is just the tip of the iceberg, I believe, for how you can use the stylus. I'm looking forward to finding more shortcuts and other features that I can use it for. I'm a pretty long-term Galaxy owner so I do have a little bias, but I believe I can still honestly say that this is one of the best phones available out there even for the price. And I can highly recommend it to anyone who likes a large phone with a long battery life and a beautiful screen and excellent camera!

Switched to google assistant, much better. Bixy is the one star loss on this review. Screen protectors seem very incompatible with the curved screen. Cant find one that works well. Cost Slippery, must have a case on it to avoid activating everything when inadvertantly touching the sides. Much easier to use with a case. Pros Dual camera. Great camera.

samsung,"So much right, Great battery, Small missteps. When I heard the Note 5 had not only a non-removable battery, but a smaller capacity compared to previous Note's, I was hesitant; especially after the S6 left a sour taste in my mouth in terms of its lasting power. But I have to say, in my short time with this device, it has impressed me. The very first day I was able to get 6 hours of Screen on Time after messing around with the phone relentlessly, installing apps, streaming music a bit, browsing the web, disabling apps, playing a few games (for maybe 40 minutes), you name it. Obviously this scenario is a bit harder on it than your normal day to day use as excessive downloading and installing of apps is fairly intensive, not to mention just playing with the new device constantly. So the first day, after charging it to 100%, it was off the charger a total of a bit over 10 hours at that point with about 10% left - but with screen on time at over 6 hours mixed with standby and all the other intensive stuff I was doing, that is a great figure which greatly eclipses what my S6 could do. Day to day it is FAR better than that though. It is clear the larger 3,000 mAh battery is not just a concession to power the larger screen and having battery life end up just matching the S6 (with its smaller ~2500 mAh battery). As it stands today, my GSam Battery Monitor app shows I get, on average, 17 hours battery life with just shy of 6 hours screen on time per complete charge. I've yet to actually run out of battery, most times having 20% or more by plug in time. So these estimates are pretty true to life, though pure standby time can see this phone last a few days easily - Samsung really upped its game on standby time on this over the S6. I never turn wifi and bluetooth off, and I have a Moto 360 connected all the time as well. You might even get slightly better life if these things don't apply to you and you keep them turned off most of the time. This phone looks as though it will not struggle to get you through a day, even under fairly heavy usage. The ""cell standby"" drain from the S6 appears to have lessened, even if not completely fixed, but at least to the point where it is no longer the biggest battery drainer (before, it had even managed to top the charts when I had 3 hours of screen on time on the S6!). Everything about the design is great, it is a nice weight without feeling too light, the rounded corners and slightly thinner width helps with one-handleability, and it is a nice step up from the all plastic build of my Note 3. It is handsome and it feels rather premium. The glass on the back does make the device feel a little bit more fragile, like you have to be more mindful and baby it some. I'd say you largely will have to be more mindful, to some degree, than you would with the previous all-plastic models. However there were concerns the all glass construction would make it far too slippery, but I don't find it too problematic. You can wrap your fingers around it pretty easily in one hand, but one handed operation where your fingers lay on the back to do most of the supporting doesn't feel too worrying either. If your hands are wet beyond a light sweat (in which case, why are you handling a smartphone lol), you'll notice the lack of grip you are probably more accustomed to on textured, plastic backed phones. But I haven't really had any issues to this point, for what that is worth. The device runs super fluid with nary a hitch to be found. Even though it has the same processor as the months old S6, I can't fault the device for not giving the processor the customary Note spec bump. It is plenty powerful and appears to be quite solid in terms of power efficiency - far more so than it appeared on the S6. I'd rather have this power/efficiency combo than a newer chip that would - more than likely - hit the battery harder. The 4 GB of RAM is nice to have, but it does seem like the overactive RAM manager still likes to kill apps, making apps require a restart rather than resume. Not always the case, but it seems to happen enough to make note of. Not a big deal to me, but it may be for others. I think this is also a battery saving measure to keep multiple apps from stacking up and unnecessarily taking CPU cycles or pinging the Internet constantly in the background. It's missing the removable battery and expandable storage, which is a knock against it - but not enough to knock a star off in my book. These are an expectation for the Note series by most, and obviously a reduction of features any way you look at it. How important they are to you depends on your usage. I have a 32 GB model after having a 32 GB Note 3 paired with a 32 GB micro SD card. I pared my glut of games back to a reasonable amount - still have a ton installed - and that's all it required for me. This was something I was doing on my Note 3, so it didn't feel like a concession when I switched to the Note 5. I also either stream music or use my iPod Touch for music, so I don't need storage for that. I don't store local video and I don't take a lot of pictures or videos, so space is fine for me. If you need more, 64 GB tops the capacity for this model and it seems pretty fair for most users. If you need more, then this is obviously going to struggle to contend for your affection since 128 GB is currently unavailable, and will be absurdly pricey when it does eventually come around. The S-Pen is still a great stylus. More responsive and far less friction on the screen than the one on my Note 3. It appears to work better for general navigation as well, requiring only a single tap (rather than a few sometimes required on my Note 3). The screen-off note writing feature is a nice one, not having to worry about the screen firing up and so on - this is a nice, immediate way to take a quick note. The features of the pop up S-Pen launcher are all familiar, excepting small tweaks to existing features like being able to take a long screen capture - say a several page webpage you'd have to scroll. The release mechanism takes a little getting used to - with the little depression it takes to get it to pop out - but once you get used to it, it works well. Any better/more secure than on the Note 3? Not to my experience, as I never had issues with the pen from the Note 3 getting accidentally pulled out, or conversely any issue getting it out of its holder. But this is a nice implementation, and adds to the slightly more refined Note experience. The base price of $700 is pretty high, but if you trade in an old phone and get the $200 credit, you're looking at a pretty fair price when matched against other phones. I am quite happy with this as an upgrade over my Note 3, and FAR happier than I was with the S6 which I had for the full 14 days before deciding to exchange it for this. If you take stock of everything you may just realize that, for you at least, the ire drawn by Internet power users is not quite that crippling or straight up device-ruining. I miss the two removed features, largely because I would rather have access to the battery to replace if the cells start going later on in the phone's life, but right now I'm quite happy with the package as it stands and have no qualms recommending it.",2015-08-25,positive,5,en,much right great battery small missteps heard note nonremovable battery smaller capacity compared previous notes hesitant especially left sour taste mouth terms lasting power say short time device impressed first day able get hours screen time messing around phone relentlessly installing apps streaming music bit browsing web disabling apps playing games maybe minutes name obviously scenario bit harder normal day day use excessive downloading installing apps fairly intensive mention playing new device constantly first day charging charger total bit hours point left screen time hours mixed standby intensive stuff great figure greatly eclipses could day day far better though clear larger mah battery concession power larger screen battery life end matching smaller mah battery stands today gsam battery monitor app shows get average hours battery life shy hours screen time per complete charge ive yet actually run battery times plug time estimates pretty true life though pure standby time see phone last days easily samsung really upped game standby time never turn wifi bluetooth moto connected time well might even get slightly better life things dont apply keep turned time phone looks though struggle get day even fairly heavy usage cell standby drain appears lessened even completely fixed least point longer biggest battery drainer even managed top charts hours screen time everything design great nice weight without feeling light rounded corners slightly thinner width helps onehandleability nice step plastic build note handsome feels rather premium glass back make device feel little bit fragile like mindful baby id say largely mindful degree would previous allplastic models however concerns glass construction would make far slippery dont find problematic wrap fingers around pretty easily one hand one handed operation fingers lay back supporting doesnt feel worrying either hands wet beyond light sweat case handling smartphone lol youll notice lack grip probably accustomed textured plastic backed phones havent really issues point worth device runs super fluid nary hitch found even though processor months old cant fault device giving processor customary note spec bump plenty powerful appears quite solid terms power efficiency far appeared id rather powerefficiency combo newer chip would likely hit battery harder gb ram nice seem like overactive ram manager still likes kill apps making apps require restart rather resume always case seems happen enough make note big deal may others think also battery saving measure keep multiple apps stacking unnecessarily taking cpu cycles pinging internet constantly background missing removable battery expandable storage knock enough knock star book expectation note series obviously reduction features way look important depends usage gb model gb note paired gb micro sd card pared glut games back reasonable amount still ton installed thats required something note didnt feel like concession switched note also either stream music use ipod touch music dont need storage dont store local video dont take lot pictures videos space fine need gb tops capacity model seems pretty fair users need obviously going struggle contend affection since gb currently unavailable absurdly pricey eventually come around spen still great stylus responsive far less friction screen one note appears work better general navigation well requiring single tap rather sometimes required note screenoff note writing feature nice one worry screen firing nice immediate way take quick note features pop spen launcher familiar excepting small tweaks existing features like able take long screen capture say several page webpage youd scroll release mechanism takes little getting used little depression takes get pop get used works well bettermore secure note experience never issues pen note getting accidentally pulled conversely issue getting holder nice implementation adds slightly refined note experience base price pretty high trade old phone get credit youre looking pretty fair price matched phones quite happy upgrade note far happier full days deciding exchange take stock everything may realize least ire drawn internet power users quite crippling straight deviceruining miss two removed features largely would rather access battery replace cells start going later phones life right im quite happy package stands qualms recommending,2,2

samsung,"No more simultaneous data and voice like you had on the Note 2 & 3. This is a great phone, but there's one real drawback the was a big surprise for me after purchase. I can no longer surf or use data while talking on the Sprint network. Why not? The Note 4 only has one radio. The Note 2 and 3 had two radios. At some time X in the future, Sprint will turn on VOIP and this will be resolved, but until that date, I will wish I hadn't ""upgraded"". Operating only one radio avoids interference and extends the battery life. More so, this won't be an issue once the network technology is upgraded to support VOIP. I suspect these are the reasons for the change. Nevertheless, it really stinks that I no longer have the functionality I've frequently used and enjoyed for 2+ years. More so, I must have read 20+ Note 4 reviews and comparisons and no one reported this drawback. If you have wifi available, then this isn't an issue, regardless of whether or not you turn on wifi calling. You can talk on the voice network and surf via wifi, or talk and surf over wifi. It's simply that Sprint doesn't yet allow VOIP on the LTE network (voice over LTE). Verizon has VOIP enabled over LTE. I'm not a user on other services, but I believe Verizon and Sprint's CDMA networks were the one's that didn't allow simultaneous talk and data.

This is an absolutely beautiful phone. You almost hate to cover it with a case or protector.

Galaxy S8 Plus Screen Protector [2-Pack], iTURBOS Full Screen Coverage 3D PET HD Screen Protector Film for Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus As for the phone itself... Wow. There are some really neat improvements to the launcher, everything feels truly improved. The calendar app feels like it comes from the future. It's fast, you can multi task, the notification window is so much more versatile (reply to texts without leaving the video you're watching... It plays behind the notification screen while you reply if you so desire). Cannot recommend highly enough. The larger screen takes a little bit of getting used to, the s5 definitely wasn't a phablet by any means, but the adjustment is worth the extra screen size and resolution. They moved the speaker and the headphone jack to the bottom of the phone. Be nicer if the speakers were on the face somehow, but this is much better than the back speaker design of S5. The natural position of your hand in a one hand hold cups the audio back at you. Having the head back on the bottom keeps the cord out of your screen. Great great great. Still get your SD card slot (be careful, it's a delicate but stubborn little thing), but I'm nowhere needing it. While i was constantly at less than 25% memory on my S5 even after using SD for pics videos and any apps that allowed. I've got an SD in there now, but haven't used it. I've loaded twice as many apps on this as on my S5 (where I'd always go web versus app if possible) and I just today cracked the 50% mark on internal storage - including every pic and video that used to be on my S5's SD. From now on, I'm planning to treat the SD as a back up for pics etc until further notice. If I'm at 50%with more apps than I'll ever actually regularly use, I'll be set for a good stretch. This all tells me that Samsung did a great job streamlining three bloat. Indeed, while there was some typical preinstall junk, I wasâ?able to delete a surprising amount of what I didn't want.

Mine fell off a low coffee table to wood floor and cracked screen, not surprised, is not covered by warrenty. $215.00 to replace. This is after having phone for one week. My prevoius phone an galaxy s4 lasted 7 to 8 years. I know noone who has not dropped their phone at least once ever 6 months. So in 7 years would have to replace screen 14 times. So now looking for a different phone.

If you want to see actual email exchange scoll down. I recieved this phone on September 13th 2019. The phone fell off a counter and the screen cracked. So i contacted samsung tech support to replace screen knowing it was not going to be covered by warrenty. But In the coarse of the conversation i was told that this was a refurbished phone and the warrenty ran out on Febuary 8th 2019. That is 8 months before i recieved this phone. I specifically chose this phone because it was listed as brandnew not refurbished with warrenty. I am extremely disapionted and had to let you know.

samsung,"FLAWLESS PERFECT PHONE! Couldn't be happier!!!! Up and running immediately.. First off... This phone is AT&T, and I use AT&T... so maybe thats why I don't have the issues of all the bad reviews. I looked up what exact model was used on AT&T.... ""SM-G892A"". SM-G892U or SM-G892T for example are T-Mobile. Educate yourself before purchase. They should interchange, but will have the carrier's default software and you MIGHT have to call to have it ""unlocked""... to move to another carrier... its free (in my area) or you can swing by a store. My last phone was T-Mobile, and would still do the T-mobile updates and had locked in Apps for T-mobile... even when on AT&T service. And there's other versions of the galaxy... some are interchangeable between carriers, some are NOT (for example, sprint doesn't use the same tech/sim card). Not all ""S8 actives"" are the same... that's why Amazon lists the smg number. Do your research. PROS: The phone itself is FLAWLESS. Its perfect, just like new. Operates perfectly. Was easy to setup (coming from another Samsung phone and having a google account). It copied my background, remembered my wifi, all data (pics, music, calendar, alarm clock), even my text messages and call history. There were a few apps that updated and needed some things tweaked to match settings on old phone... but it was LARGELY a flawless transfer done in one evening watching TV. CONS: This phone didn't come in samsung packaging, didn't have samsung fast charger with it (random non-quick charger and cord), didn't have instruction manual. Shipped at 4% battery. None of this really matters to me. Quick charge would be nice... but I've already got 2. The phone itself is kind of heavy... but I feel that way every time I upgrade... the phones are just plain bigger. The weight of it makes me glad I ordered a tough/rubber case for it. Fingerprint scanner on the back is really nice any time you'll be holding the phone, but have to use another option if leaving flat on a desk (or wireless charger). Bixby is annoying (maybe I'd get accustomed to it... does seem to have some nice features once setup)... but I wish you didn't have to agree to its terms just to open the app in order to disable that hyper sensitive side button. I turned it off and use that button to quick launch the camera. Foil hatters may REALLY dislike this, but its probably here to stay... everyone has an all knowing ""hey google"", ""alexa"", ""bixby"", etc etc. FINAL ANSWER... 5+ stars, would buy again, VERY glad I didn't go to the carrier's store to pay full price on only the newest phone options. ***Excuse the picture quality... taken with my old phone while this phone was setting up.",2019-08-27,positive,5,en,flawless perfect phone couldnt happier running immediately first phone att use att maybe thats dont issues bad reviews looked exact model used att smga smgu smgt example tmobile educate purchase interchange carriers default software might call unlocked move another carrier free area swing store last phone tmobile would still tmobile updates locked apps tmobile even att service theres versions galaxy interchangeable carriers example sprint doesnt use techsim card actives thats amazon lists smg number research pros phone flawless perfect like new operates perfectly easy setup coming another samsung phone google account copied background remembered wifi data pics music calendar alarm clock even text messages call history apps updated needed things tweaked match settings old phone largely flawless transfer done one evening watching tv cons phone didnt come samsung packaging didnt samsung fast charger random nonquick charger cord didnt instruction manual shipped battery none really matters quick charge would nice ive already got phone kind heavy feel way every time upgrade phones plain bigger weight makes glad ordered toughrubber case fingerprint scanner back really nice time youll holding phone use another option leaving flat desk wireless charger bixby annoying maybe id get accustomed seem nice features setup wish didnt agree terms open app order disable hyper sensitive side button turned use button quick launch camera foil hatters may really dislike probably stay everyone knowing hey google alexa bixby etc etc final answer stars would buy glad didnt go carriers store pay full price newest phone options excuse picture quality taken old phone phone setting,2,2

samsung,"Faulty Device Received; Still waiting for device to be fixed - awful customer support. Just wanna share my rant on ""don't buy s6 edge"". There was a wifi problem with the device that I purchased on the release date. Would stay connected, but upstream / downstream freezes every 20~30 seconds. I tried on different network, security settings, and bandwidth, but problem persisted. Then sent it for service at Samsung repair center, and I was promised of expedited service. More than a week passed, still no news. I called the service center today, and found out that device is still sitting in the warehouse, waiting to be repaired. And here's why S6 is awful : 1. They have not fully tested S6 prior to its release. Lots of bugs (app crash / battery drain), which most of them are negligible, but ones like wifi problem, is critical. Good luck on picking the phone lottery. 2. Awful customer service. I had to call three times / chat twice, spending more than 4 hours to find out where my device is and whether it is being fixed or not. The service center promised for expedited service, as well as promised the date when I will get the device back, but only later found out those words were nothing but empty promise to dupe customers. Also, as I escalated my call to higher level agent (or manager), they were keep blaming on me and making falsified statements that I never received an expedited service - whereas, online repair tracker clearly indicates the device was sent in for an expedited service. Classic blame-game from incompetent / unwilling call agents. Prepare to be frustrated when you have issues with the phone. Expect more than an hour for a call. BOTTOM LINE : Do not buy the device. Don't be fooled by the looks. Service is awful at most. Go ahead and buy iPhone or Moto X. They do not screw customer like Samsung, and they take responsibilities for faulty devices. People at Samsung do not respect your time, and would not acknowledge their fault in poor manufacturing.

samsung,"6"" AMOLED, 4000mAh and Dual SIM for $150. What more do you want?. Want more reasons to buy this phone? It runs like a champ, its fast enough for its price but the specs are actually pretty darn good. The camera, whilst is not that good for video, considering its lack of any sort of IS, is surprisingly good for taking photos, including a Ultra-Wide mode that makes photos sooo much easier. It includes Dual SIM compatibility, something every phone should come with, coming from someone with two numbers. Also, the back panel, whilst not being glass, it doesn't feel cheap at all. And it's actually good if you are the sort of people that cracks phone glasses a lot. The screen has good colors, deep blacks, and my only complaint is that for a 6 inch display 720p is a little low, but to be honest, regularly you won't notice it (unless you're looking for it) and, to be honest, a 6 inch phone with a AMOLED panel for this cheap is too much for what you may find. The battery life is a freaking champ. A 720p, 3GB device of course drains less battery than higher class devices but if you sum up a 4000mAh battery, this phone can last you the full day without reaching 20%.

samsung,"Mixed feelings.. Got this for my youngest, we're between upgrades with AT&T and need a quick fix because our last cheapo phones are now falling apart... The Good: Upgradeable memory via SD Card. Easy seamless swap of SIM with our AT&T Contract line. Price was reasonable, under the circumstances. Supposedly mil-spec rugged phone...kinda wanted that because my boy is 12. It would be really cool if this could make it through the cold cycle on our washing machine, but I'm not gonna hold my breath! The Bad: Mine arrived with a spot the size of a pencil eraser on the glass that was heavily scratched as though someone had deliberately removed a mark the size of a logo...yet there were also logos on it, so I have no idea what the reason for that was. Perhaps a prior user had engraved his initials into the glass and they were obliterated by the seller? I don't know. It was in the far upper right corner though, not obscuring anything in the main screen area. It was difficult to properly close the back after I swapped the SD Card and SIM. I'd think I had it, but one little plastic tab along the edge would be open, I'd push that into place and another would pop out. The screw lock thing that is supposed to lock it down turns very easily and feels like it could accidentally move to the open position just from jostling in normal use. Aside from the fact that if one of the port covers should ever break, the waterproof dustproof etc. feature will be shot, I question whether the back of the thing in its closed position (as best as I could get it) will fulfill that promise either. I'm not a beginner when it comes to gadgets, I've never had a phone's back panel be quite this irritating to attempt to properly close. The screen does not look as nice (resolution) as the other phone I bought for my other child, which was an HTC in a similar price range. However, this phone has 5 homescreens for apps and such, whereas the HTC has only 3. All this being said...I put a case on it to make it just a bit tougher, what with my concerns about the back and all. The case happens to also obscure the scratch spot on the glass more or less. But with a case, this phone becomes a big, clunky heavy brick-feeling monstrosity of an object. So the bad news is my son can't carry it in his pants pocket like he wants to, but the good news is...that my son can't carry it in his pants pocket and forget and leave it there when those pants go into the wash, so my wondering about whether it would survive what killed one of his former phones...is probably a non-issue. TL;DR version: My mind is NOT blown. There are better phones out there.

The S10 has a data & app migration app that made it simple to move just what she wanted from the Note to the S10. She was even able to keep texts (which I assumed she would lose).

samsung,"Rugged, Water Resistant, Amazing Camera - The Phone for People with an Active Life!. Having owned several Samsung Galaxy models over the years starting with the S3 and moving up, I had held onto my S5 well after the S6 came onto the market. It did everything I wanted it to do, and so I saw no reason to upgrade. When the S6 Active hit the market though the promise of a phone that could withstand the environment, the constant abuse we put our phones through and even being underwater was too good to pass up. I decided to take the plunge and I'm sure glad I did -- the S6 Active has become my favorite of the Samsung Galaxy line! Let's start out talking about the feature that drew me to it in the beginning -- the ruggedness. If you read the marketing materials and such online you'll find out this phone was designed like every phone should be - to withstand the day in, day out, constant dropping, spilled water, throw it in your pocket/backpack/briefcase/suitcase life. They even claim (and it is true!) that you don't need a protective case. Drop it in the pool? No worries, just fish it out and continue using it and leave the rice in the cupboard! If you are anything like me then your phone goes through an obstacle course every day. Let's face it -- they needed to be designed to handle the rugged terrains of our daily lives, not to look pretty! With the S6 Active they are! I particularly enjoyed the fact that it is water resistant to the point it can even be underwater, and still the headphone and charging jacks are not sealed off. This is a mass improvement over the S5 in that the charging door alone was enough to make you run screaming. Another great feature of the phone is that it is very dust resistant. The older Samsung Galaxy phones had crevices, especially around some of the forward-facing cameras, that loved to collect dust that you couldn't get to. Over time your pictures looked more like a grainy Polaroid than the sharp, clear pics you were used to when it was new. They did a great design keeping everything flat and level and eliminating as many dust-catching angles as they could. The battery is 3,500mAH battery, a marked improvement over the standard S6. I know my old S5 I had to charge at least twice a day to get it to last, and with this one I find myself charging it every 1.5 days. Not bad for someone who lives by his phone. Picture clarity is fantastic - even the forward facing camera takes amazing clear pics. You can program the ""Active"" button (on the left side of the phone) to trigger the camera for either taking pics or bringing it up when the phone is locked. A handy feature to capture those ""quick moments"" before they get away. The call quality is good. The sound for the speakerphone is still a little light to my taste, but gets the job done. I would hope in future models they make the speaker for calls a bit more powerful. It can be difficult to use if there is a lot of background noise or if you are using it outside. Overall, a welcome upgrade from my S5 and a much welcome upgrade for my active life!",2015-07-17,positive,5,en,rugged water resistant amazing camera phone people active life owned several samsung galaxy models years starting moving held onto well came onto market everything wanted saw reason upgrade active hit market though promise phone could withstand environment constant abuse put phones even underwater good pass decided take plunge im sure glad active become favorite samsung galaxy line lets start talking feature drew beginning ruggedness read marketing materials online youll find phone designed like every phone withstand day day constant dropping spilled water throw pocketbackpackbriefcasesuitcase life even claim true dont need protective case drop pool worries fish continue using leave rice cupboard anything like phone goes obstacle course every day lets face needed designed handle rugged terrains daily lives look pretty active particularly enjoyed fact water resistant point even underwater still headphone charging jacks sealed mass improvement charging door alone enough make run screaming another great feature phone dust resistant older samsung galaxy phones crevices especially around forwardfacing cameras loved collect dust couldnt get time pictures looked like grainy polaroid sharp clear pics used new great design keeping everything flat level eliminating many dustcatching angles could battery mah battery marked improvement standard know old charge least twice day get last one find charging every days bad someone lives phone picture clarity fantastic even forward facing camera takes amazing clear pics program active button left side phone trigger camera either taking pics bringing phone locked handy feature capture quick moments get away call quality good sound speakerphone still little light taste gets job done would hope future models make speaker calls bit powerful difficult use lot background noise using outside overall welcome upgrade much welcome upgrade active life,2,2

The glasstic back looks premium, the weight of the phone is perfect. It has enough weight that it's not too light to fly out your hands, but it's not giving you a workout when holding it. There is a slight chin but nothing you couldn't live with. Screen display is eye catching and you are able to utilize the whole screen when watching videos. It's not as fast as a flagship phone but it's not laggy either. It's just a little slower It has cool features like fast charging, picture in picture, multi window and it's pretty much fully customizable.

samsung,"Great 4K video Camera Phone. Galaxy S5 is an outdated model when I bought it in 09/2017. Galaxy phones are now at S8 or higher, with price to match. This S5 is under $200! Phones have become everyone's main camera, nobody lugs around a 2 lb Nikon everywhere. I bought this mainly for the 4K video camera. Under good lighting, video is comparable to a $800 Sony 4k camcorder, i.e. standard 4k brilliance. For still photos, it's a 16 mp camera w/ 16x9 default aspect ratio, also brilliant in good lighting. Now everything I record, video and stills, are 16x9 standardized for editing, filling a TV completely. For video use, if you zoom in at all, it's no longer 4k, because it's not optical zoom. It's digital zoom, which is like cropping the outside to look like you are zooming in. Use only the max wide angle shot for 4k resolution. Same for still photos. Note that for Android phones, 4k recording has a segment length limit of 5 min. If you want to record a full basketball game, you need to press the start button every 5 min. But for everyday use, the 5 min limit is not a problem. Later Galaxy models may have a longer time limit. As to regular phone, internet, & other functions, I only need the basics, and they are more than adequate. There's really no reason to buy a $800 iPhone which can't do 4k, or take photos in 16x9.

samsung,"Great phone with s*** design decisions which screw up day to day usage. You pay almost 900 dollars at the AT&T store and get this kind of retardedness... 1) NO SINGLE HAND USAGE: I don't think the morons who design these devices & software actually test them for usability...the most ANNOYING disrupting aspect is that the edges keep responding to any accidental palm etc touches which happen ALL the time with single hand usage. The simplest solution is to just set the display/touch area to be the flat section of the screen EXCEPT for apps that actually make use of the edges 2) DISPLAY: Wrap your head around this: Since the normal display extends all the way to the edges, you can't properly read text etc since its curved. Usability is greatly affected by all this lack of thought while building on an otherwise awesome physical feature ('Edge') As mentioned above, the EDGE USAGE SHOULD BE AN OPTIONAL FEATURE 3) HOME BUTTON: COPY Apple INCLUDING all its faults: The home button being a click-button instead of touch is just plaid dumb considering the other buttons are touch and it's so much easier to touch than click each time. It also is the main reason for the fingerprint reader issues 4) HOPELESS FINGERPRINT UNLOCK: Because of the physical home button, one needs to press it to unlock...this pressure causes the fingerprint to get smudged and hence the reader cannot unlock the phone properly...almost every 2nd unlock of mine has this issue (which means I first need to press the button to activate the screen and then again touch the home button for the fingerprint to be read accurately and unlock the phone). I've tried everything from re-recording my fingerprints etc to different angles of finger placement etc. - In contrast, My HTC A9 takes less than 1 SECOND to unlock - and it has no clicking of the home button involved...its Home button is simply touch sensitive and placing my thumb on it for 1 sec unlocks it perfectly EVERY time. - Also, anytime my thumb is not perfectly placed on the reader, it cannot recognize and unlock. In contrast, my HTC A9 handles multiple degrees of non-flat placement for a SINGLE fingerprint. A9 has the hands on best fingerprint unlock ever. AND the A9 is a great phone. If it wasn't for its 2850 mAh battery and a relatively inferior camera+display (compared to S7 edge though of their own accord they're quite good) I would've advised the whole world to just get the A9 - it's my fav 2016 smartphone. The rest is great. Battery life is great. Display is great, camera is great, etc. But the above factor in so heavily for me and likely others too 'cos the issues above happen constantly through regular usage.",2016-04-26,negative,2,en,great phone design decisions screw day day usage pay almost dollars att store get kind retardedness single hand usage dont think morons design devices software actually test usabilitythe annoying disrupting aspect edges keep responding accidental palm etc touches happen time single hand usage simplest solution set displaytouch area flat section screen except apps actually make use edges display wrap head around since normal display extends way edges cant properly read text etc since curved usability greatly affected lack thought building otherwise awesome physical feature edge mentioned edge usage optional feature home button copy apple including faults home button clickbutton instead touch plaid dumb considering buttons touch much easier touch click time also main reason fingerprint reader issues hopeless fingerprint unlock physical home button one needs press unlockthis pressure causes fingerprint get smudged hence reader cannot unlock phone properlyalmost every nd unlock mine issue means first need press button activate screen touch home button fingerprint read accurately unlock phone ive tried everything rerecording fingerprints etc different angles finger placement etc contrast htc takes less second unlock clicking home button involvedits home button simply touch sensitive placing thumb sec unlocks perfectly every time also anytime thumb perfectly placed reader cannot recognize unlock contrast htc handles multiple degrees nonflat placement single fingerprint hands best fingerprint unlock ever great phone wasnt mah battery relatively inferior cameradisplay compared edge though accord theyre quite good wouldve advised whole world get fav smartphone rest great battery life great display great camera great etc factor heavily likely others cos issues happen constantly regular usage,0,2

The 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 835 already made it futureproof. When I say ""Futureproof"" it does not mean it will last forever. But this phone should be good through 2020 or even 2021. The display is still beautiful by 2018 standards. Front facing and rear camera still respectible 14-15 months later. Not a selling point for me, but sometimes I do take pictures. Fingerprint scanner placement that reviewers have long complained about, it's a non issue for me. Using tbe phone for a few days made my brain memorize it's placement. Happy Samsung did not get rid of the fingerprint reader like Apple did. It's a huge selling point for me. It makes no sense to upgrade to a Note 9. Sure, it has some minor upgrades. But nothing major. Reason for 4 stars? My S- Pen broke from a small drop. Should not have happened. That's no excuse. Only reason why it gets a 4 from me. They also need to make it so it stays in with drops. That has gotten better since my Note 2, but it still pops out with a hard enough drop.

I like Apples hardware but I hate iOS, so I stick to android devices. After working several jobs selling cell phones, and working with them all the time I always choose to buy samsung. I just think the Galaxy series phones have been really good. Well, the time came for my S3 to upgrade and I was planning on getting the newest ""S"" phone which at the time was the S5. After playing around with one for a bit I just wasn't crazy about it. It seemed bigger than my S3 by a noticeable amount, and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off. I didn't care about the S Health or anything like that. I care about speed, and features. Thats where the Note shines. It is a large phone, but its actually not that much bigger than an S5. An S5 with an otterbox is bigger than my Note with a slim grip case. I have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all. Also the Note has awesome features.

I have been afraid to take the leap to buy a new phone as I use sim cards from non major carriers and have used an old galaxy primecore since 2016. With all the new phones out there, I was afraid but knew I needed to have at the very least 32G ( my last phone only had 8G) The phone is absolutely beautiful! It's light it's display is incredible and the transferring from old to new phones was effortlessly done by the genius that samsung is. I have also used an LG G4 in the past and it burnt up inside. So Samsung became my phone. This may seem like a simple phone to some but it's capable of so much and more than can be written in this review. It's a perfect phone with dual sim. I love that each sim receives it's own SMS as well. You can receive calls on each number which is great and each can have it's own tone of course.

I've had to do this about six times a day with this phone. It also deletes any new text messages upon rebooting. I also found online that this isn't an uncommon problem, and there appears to be no support from the hardware manufacturer. If you're looking for a Windows phone, just a get a Nokia. Any Nokia, really or the HTC One W8.

samsung,"Too good to get the Galaxy s6 or iPhone6 for the money.. Just the best phone ever... period the end. It lives up to the hype. All kinks worked out either by Samsung or verizon. The 5.0 update has been fixed because Verizon waits to release them after they see how it works on other providers and doesn't update until after they are fixed. The many features have been seamless so far. The battery life is very good but it almost doesn't matter because a twenty minute charge gets you up to 60 to 70 % charge that lasts the rest of any day. A ten minute charge can get you back to 30% from 10%. The 30% charge lasts for hours. TheRe are features I didn't think I would use like hover to enlarge pictures. I use it all the time. Turning on ""OK Google"" to respond without touching a button let's you make calls search the internet and more without picking up the phone... and so on. I think it's better than the s6 because it has a replaceable battery (although after market batteries don't charge as fast as the Samsung battery ) and you can add 128gb of SD card memory! The video camera and still camera have been well documented. But the panorama, dual camera mode, low light settings, and much more are amazing. There isn't a need for other apps to do the different things like HDR and fast burst.

samsung,"Amazon Wireless and VZW. To preface the entire review, i was researching this device with VZW for over 2 months. Amazon has always had the lowest price, verizon couldn't even come close to matching it. The process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information. When trying to go through the process VZW customer service verified who I was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information I needed. Luckily the Amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what I needed. While I was on the phone with VZW, at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from Amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories (which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing). After finally receiving my phone two days later, I tried activating my device. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with different VZW reps to help activate the device. No one could help me. I guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day, but they ported my number from sprint already. I was without service for almost 1 whole day. The following day was Thanksgiving when I needed to activate it, but VZW's support number was closed due to the holiday. Luckily i was able to connect with someone at Amazon who had a direct contact number, who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running. If it wasnt for Amazon I would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone. After buying the device at $199.99 on Nov 26, I found the device price was lowered. I called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the $50 difference. Which increased the monetary value for Amazon wireless even further! The only down side (besides hours on the phone trying to activate) was the fact that although I ordered the protection plan through VZW when ordering with Amazon, Verizon had no record of that. As long as it is within the first 30 days you can call VZW to add it. I had read a previous review that said that, which made me double check a week later after activation. All in All, i had a lot of hiccups with the process, but the Amazon wireless customer service made right by everything I went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business.

What I like about this over the A10 is the extras like camera, fingerprint, fast charge and its much faster. Worth the extra few bucks.

samsung,"Great phone with a couple of annoying things. Everyone knows how great the phone is in pretty much every aspect, but I will address the two most annoying things about this phone and the solutions that worked for me. 1. The fingerprint scanner is fancy and supposed to be secure, but it failed miserably when I saved my fingerprints the first two times. I had about 50% recognition only, if that. I thought I had it figured out with a pattern of scanning the print, but then I found a video on this trick and worked better than anything else I tried before. How to fix it: Instead of scanning the same fingerprint 16 or so times at different angles, to get one single fingerprint profile. Start scanning once your right thumb, for example, and when repositioning instead of placing your right thumb again, use your left thumb, then your right thumb again, and so on until you complete one fingerprint profile. I was amazed on how fast and how accurately the phone recognized both prints. Almost 100% recognition now. 2. The badge count was, on purpose, messed up by Samsung. For example, when you swipe down and dismiss a notification, the badge count goes away, counted as addressed. Some people like the way Samsung did it, but I do not. How to fix it: The is no way to fix this with the stock Samsung one UI. I had to install Nova launcher Prime. This allows the count to remain when you dismiss a notification. In the same way, if you have 50 emails, and delete one, the count will go down by one on the badge, and not make all of them go away the Samsung designed it. I hope this helps someone not be as frustrated as I was.",2019-03-21,positive,4,en,great phone couple annoying things everyone knows great phone pretty much every aspect address two annoying things phone solutions worked fingerprint scanner fancy supposed secure failed miserably saved fingerprints first two times recognition thought figured pattern scanning print found video trick worked better anything else tried fix instead scanning fingerprint times different angles get one single fingerprint profile start scanning right thumb example repositioning instead placing right thumb use left thumb right thumb complete one fingerprint profile amazed fast accurately phone recognized prints almost recognition badge count purpose messed samsung example swipe dismiss notification badge count goes away counted addressed people like way samsung fix way fix stock samsung one ui install nova launcher prime allows count remain dismiss notification way emails delete one count go one badge make go away samsung designed hope helps someone frustrated,2,2

samsung,"Edge models poorly designed for durability.

Made sense--larger surface area, larger risk of cracking. I thought I could go in informed, and do this without issue. I should've listened, though. The impact glass guards you can get for Edge models pop right off after a couple hours, making that way to guard them useless. Any case that's not industrial grade will leave the edges exposed to impact damage. I can see how Samsung wanted the Edge model to be new and trendy, because yes, the concept of the edge notifications and menus is new and different. However, notice they didn't make another after the S7 Edge. I assume it's from the realization that their idea was shot.

Unfortunately, yesterday I plugged in the USB cable to charge the 'phone, and heard a ""pop"", which turned out to be an indicator of it's quick and merciful death. So it only lasted about 14 months.

I bought this phone in april 2017 and I got it in May 2017. First off, this phone came DEAD not even 1% battery charge, so I initially thought something was wrong. Charging the phone wasn't a problem, it did indeed have fast charging but after 3 weeks of using the charger, the cord stopped registering as fast charging and developed a serious issue basically taking hours to charge from 1-50%. Secondly, as if charging the phone wasn't bad enough, the battery would decrease 10% in almost 10 minutes, it was awful, I tried using another fast charger, issue still went on. This was happening since I bought the phone! Finally, i decided to call Samsung to see if I could get a warranty replacement on the battery since that's the obvious problem, Samsung told me that the warranty on the phone had expired since June 2016! That's ridiculous, the warranty had already been expired for almost 2 years when I got the phone, Samsung even told me that's probably the reason why Mango Wireless was selling the phone online.

samsung,"This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek. This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling! Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone. In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Homeâ?button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible. This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use! One other function they did away with - because of the âHomeâ?button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot. Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to! The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR. When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then Iâve been HOOKED! I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds itâs low-light capabilities of it's predecessors! In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in âCameraâ?. I love that as an inner (or Yelp) âFoodiesâ? I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased! Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with! Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets! As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities. I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my âTalk and Surfâ?function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so itâs a toss up! As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.

samsung,"I bought the new note 10 plus as a gift for Samsung so they can keep it. I preordered the note10 plus so i could receive it soon as it was available for shipping. When i received the device it was new looked nice. As i was getting familiar with the device I kept seeing the commercials about the 30 min fast charging. I noticed mine would take over 4 hours to charge from maybe a 10%percent to get back to 100%. After messing with the settings, and knowing that 5G connectivity is around the corner if not already available in certain areas. My device said auto connect to 2g and 3g, with the majority being connected to 2g. (I did not purchase the 5g model) I called Samsung, they had me chat with a representative through text. This device is supposed to come with a 12 month warranty but they acted like I did something and am trying to get over on them. They asked if I'd dropped or exposed the device to water more than a few times during the chat session. Didn't offer any type of repair or exchange. They walked me through numerous trouble shooting options. (Factory reset) That didn't work so they gave me information to one of their connected repair shops. I took the device in and immediately the gentleman said that sounds like a software issue and here we do the physical things like cracked screen etc. I call Samsung again get passed the chat process finally talk to a real person. This representative was nice, but the same questions about dropping and water exposure. Explained the process I've already been through, finally agrees to get me a shipping label since other options haven't worked. They required me to send charging cable and (my sim card) already explained that i tried numerous sim cards even a different carrier since it's unlocked, (a guy from work let me use his real quick) same issues. I sent the item, received email updates about the status, like they received it, it's being worked on etc. It was returned with a note explaining what they did to it and that issue was corrected. Immediately I noticed they hadn't addressed the connectivity issue only charging problem. I had to wait for the battery to die down to see how long it took to charge. Remember the commercial said lightning fast 30 min? Well mine still took over 4 hours to fully charge. I received a survey by email asking how did we do. I was honest and was not the best review stated my unhappiness about all the hoops that I have to jump through and after paying over $1200 I still don't have the device with the capabilities I thought I purchased. Received an email with a small apology and said ship it to us once more and we'll replace the device to make it right. I did that and it's been around 3 weeks and iI have no confirmation emails with status updates. I tracked my package through UPS and it was delivered and received. I finally called and they told me they had received it (two days later than UPS records) No further information since they barely received it. I called again and asked they informed me they have to take it apart to find the problem. I said I was told to send it back to get a replacement. They said no they are going to inspect it for water damage or evidence of dropping, and they are going to repair it if they deem it can not be repaired they will send a replacement. Also they said the connectivity issue was not addressed because I refused to send in my personal sim card. I still have no status updates of any kind no emails nothing. So my advice is not to deal with Samsung directly and to go to your carrier where they exchange them easier and let them deal work Samsung. Im extremely disappointed with Samsung over this ordeal I started with the S5 and have bought galaxy exclusively for my family over the years including tvs and a refrigerator. Now that it was time to upgrade the kids s7 edge and s8 active I let them both go to the dark side and get Iphones. Didn't want to Jane to deal with this issue 2 more times.

samsung,"Former iPhone user loves the Note 8. I am a long time iPhone user. I first tried the Motorola Droid before switching to the iPhone and the difference was night and day. That was back when Android phones were very slow, crash prone and unrefined. By comparison, I loved the fast and silky smooth responsiveness of iOS, the ability to share apps, the tight integration with our Macs and the idiot-proof operation. That was all before Apple tried to get cute. Iâd say iPhone âenhancementsâ?started going south somewhere around iOS 8. Suddenly, instead of admiring how iOS always just worked, I found myself seriously questioning if Apple did enough pre-release testing and quality control checks prior to releasing new versions of iOS. It felt like we, the actual users, were the beta testers. The hardware also started getting less reliable as well, beginning with the iPhone 5. I had to have my iPhone 5âs defective battery replaced under Appleâs own little iPhone 5 batterygate scandal that many people seem to have forgotten about. Our entire family owns iPhones and weâve all experienced some strange issues at one point or another. These were issues like defective cameras (hardware, not software, requiring hardware replacement of the camera), cases coming apart, numerous faulty battery issues and other quirks. I had a 6-plus that would shut down and display the empty battery icon with remaining battery levels in the 20-30% range. As soon as I plugged it into AC power, the phone would power on and the battery charge status would instantly shoot up to 20%. I was tiring of Appleâs deteriorating quality and angry at the fact that they werenât really innovating enough to justify yearly upgrades. The final straw was when they revealed that they now wanted to charge me a minimum of $1,000 for their newest flagship model. That greedy move pretty much drove me away from Apple. I no longer find their products worth the premium prices they charge. Now, Samsung was not perfect either. My son owned an S4 and Note 5 and both had charging port issues wihin a year. That made me very leery of Samsung. However, the switch to a USB-C charging port as well as the fact that I knew Samsung would do everything in their power to ensure this Note was perfect after the Note 7 debacle convinced me to give this phone a try. So far, I love it. The size and weight are perfect, even in a case. The phone is still easily pocketable despite its apparent substantial size. Voice quality on calls rivals my home phone. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. I compared it to an iPhone X in store and I actually prefer the richer and deeper color saturation of the Noteâs screen. The iPhone X screen was a little brighter but also more washed out looking. I keep my Note at 50% brightness all the time and it still looks stunning. My iPhone 7 looked too dim at 50% brightness. The dimmest I could go on the iPhone and still have decent screen quality both indoors and outdoors (not in direct sunlight) was about 75%. I donât like auto-dim feature on either phone because it never sets the screen to a brightness that I prefer when indoors. The Note screen is also razor sharp thanks to a higher pixel density. I am not a fan of facial recognition on any device and donât use it on the Note, nor would I use it on an iPhone. I also do not use the iris scanner. I figured having my fingerprints recorded on both the iPhone and Note was all the biometric privacy Iâm willing to give up. Why put my face scan and iris scan out in the cloud as well? After hearing everything Snowden claimed, color me paranoid. I do think the Note 8âs fingerprint scanner is in a very goofy location and requires awkwardly reaching around the camera while trying not to press on the camera lens to use. However, the fingerprint scanner placement and the annoying Bixby are the only cons I can really find worth complaining about with the Note 8. The speed of the Note is fantastic and I breeze through apps and tasks just as quickly and easily as I did on my iPhone, sometimes even faster. I have yet to experience any freezing or slowdown. I did deactivate the always on screen but only because I have an Android Wear companion watch, so there is no need to have an always on screen showing redundant data. As far as companion watches, I will admit that Apple does smart watches best. If that is a considerably important feature, I give the nod to Apple. My Android Wear watch isn't bad. Itâs just not nearly as refined as the Apple Watch. On the flipside, Android Auto is much better than Apple Car Play in my opinion, especially the ability to use either Google Navigation or Waze in your carâs navigation screen, both of which blow the doors off Apple Maps, especially the latter. I get great battery life from my Note and easily get two days of use out of a charge, even with it paired to my vehicle and smartwatch all day. The S pen is a nice tool if you do a lot of hand note taking but I find it easier to just type. The Note charges very quickly and I can charge it late at night and still have it complete before going to bed. That prevents leaving it plugged in all night and risking overuse of the battery. Yes, all these phones have built in overcharge protection but being connected to AC power still wears down the battery over time. Iâve had this told to me multiple times by Apple Store âgeniusesâ?as they tried to claim how all my iPhone battery issues were likely my fault due to allowing the phone to charge overnight. The excuses changed after I shared that I already knew this and therefore never charge anything overnight. The camera on the Note 8 is the best Iâve ever had on a smartphone. My wife and I always envied the photos taken by her sister with her Note 5. We would all be at the same events and taking the same photos but her photos were sharper and more vivid than our iPhone pics. That was another feature that influenced my decision to switch. Another reason was the better reliability of Googleâs calendar over Appleâs iCloud calendar. I switched to Goolge on my iPhone last year after iCloudâs calendar failed to sync several very important reminders across all my devices and failed to alert me as instructed. Iâd create or update important events on my iPad or Mac and ithey wouldn't sync across all my devices or to my phone. It feels a little weird as an almost exclusive Apple user to own an Android phone. I myself own two MacBooks, three iPads, an Apple TV and I owned an iPhone 7 and Apple Watch before giving both away after purchasing this Note 8. However, I have fallen in love with the performance and looks of my Note 8. It feels so new and refreshing compared to the last few iterations of the iPhone (6, 6S, 7, 8) that were essentially identical phones with very slight and almost unnoticeable differences before the release of the iPhone X. However, $1,000 is a stiff price of admission to pay to finally get the first truly uniquely different iPhone in three years. I saved nearly $500 by purchasing the Note 8 rather than the 256GB IPhone X I ever so briefly considered purchasing. With stellar performance, a sleek body, outstanding screen quality, fantastic camera and the ability to handle all my smartphone needs just as well or better than The iPhone, Samsung is giving me every reason to make this switch permanent. If not for the awkward fingerprint scanner placement and unwanted annoyances like Bixby (which can be disabled by the way), it would absolutely be a perfect 5.",2017-11-04,positive,4,en,former iphone

That being said, this is an all purpose cell phone that comes with loads of functionality and can stand the beating.

samsung,"Really pleased with this phone - actual buyer.. First off, I bought this phone with my own hard earned money and bought it through Amazon. This is not a sponsored review. I've had Samsung Note phones because I like the big screens. My old note 3 (which I loved) starting having problems with WiFi and GPS reception. So I started looking for replacement phones and found this one. My carrier is Verizon. You have to go into the Verizon store with your old phones sim card so they can burn you a new sim card. I was expecting to get a hard time from the store and was surprised at how nice the experience was! They took my old sim, created a new sim in about 5 minutes with no charge! Very nice. And now on to the phone. So I was loving my old Note 3 and didn't really expect to have that much of a better experience.. wow was I wrong. So this is not a comprehensive review , just some of my observations and things that I really liked about this phone. Also, bear in mind I've been using older Samsung Note phones for the past 5 years. So all the tech upgrades are fun. - The screen: Almost as wide as the 5.7"" screen on my old Note 3 but is taller. So text is almost as large but with more space for content. Of course, resolution is amazing, colors pop and this thing gets really really bright. The first time I used it in full sunlight I was amazed! I could actually see text perfectly in FULL SUNLIGHT. Wow... what an improvement over my old phone. I was also worried about the curved sides of the screen distorting text and pictures and such. No problem at all. I still feel the curved edges are a bit of a gimmick but it does not detract from the usability of the phone. And no I don't care about any of the edge menus and stuff like that. - The CPU / Speed I thought my old Note 3 was fast. This thing is blazing fast. I mean, everything you do is almost instantaneous. Now I'm spoiled and expect everything to pop up instantly. - The Camera I've got it set up so that if you press the power button twice the camera comes up. It comes up instantly. You can take a photo immediately. Then you can take at least 1 photo a second. The photos look great. - The speaker It's mono and on the bottom of the phone. At least 50% louder than the speaker on my old Note 3, at that was loud. I'm so happy with the speaker on this phone, I can listen to podcasts when I'm in the kitchen. I just pop the phone on the granite counter and crank the volume and I don't need an external speaker like on my old phone. Again, I'm pleased and surprised. Phone calls on the speaker are loud and clear. - The fingerprint reader. Wow... It's instantaneous. Seriously. You place your finger on the sensor and it's on in less than a second. So easy. - Weight and size. It's taller than my old Note 3 but lighter and slimmer. Still fits in my back or front pocket fine. I've got it in a case with a pop socket in the back. Drilled a hole in the case so that the pop socket is attached to the back glass on the phone. So the pop socket is secured to the phone, acts as a handle and a mini stand when I place it on a counter to watch a video. - Wireless charging. Picked up a $15 wireless charger from Amazon. Very nice. I just lay it on the charger when I go to sleep. Super convenient. - SD card capable. Took my old 64 gig SD card from my note 3 and popped it into this one. Nice, all my books and videos, photos and tunes came along for the ride. So anyway... I'm really glad I bought this phone. no regrets at all. I really don't have any cons. I just dig it.

samsung,"Galaxy S7 is a great phone. The one I had was defective. Whatever you've read it will NOT work be full function w Domestic GSM. Samsung is a good brand; the s7 is an excellent phone. This would have been my second. And on that bases I would recommend buying one. And the sale price of a refurbish phone is also in-line with market. Notwithstanding, I had to return this phone. The particular phone had GPS problems. Even in open sky and interstate, it would say GPS signal cannot be located. Also, while WIFI did work, I noticed that the signal strengths wasn't quite as good as my other S7. The other things is that I took answers given this phone will work with non Verizon networks at face value. The answer isn't that simple. The basic features will work. But key features like redial recent, call return, easy access to voice mail, will not. That's because while the GSM is unlocked, it's unlocked for international dialing not US. And this was confirmed my my experience (""the internation number you have dialed is not available to your service). It was confirmed by the US GSM carrier.

samsung,"Great feature packed phone. Love this phone. I had to wait for it over a weekend to arrive but it arrived slightly ahead of schedule. The phone has great features, and a lot of little things you notice only after playing with it for a week - like it checked your hearing and adjusts the phone and audio to compensate for your particular hearing deficiencies. It makes a world of difference when listening on earbuds. The phone's supplied earbuds work well but are a little weak in the bass range. Otherwise the sound is clear and clean. The S Pen is fantastic. You can write notes and save them from the lock screen, which I have already used a couple of times. Once you break the habit of using your fingers to do everything and using the pen instead, your phone's screen doesn't need to be cleaned nearly as often. Depending on how much I use it I can go for a day to a day and a half between charges. It does take a bit longer to charge it because the battery is 1/3 bigger than my previous phone. Using wireless charging it takes a little over 3 hours from a nearly dead battery to full charge. The screen is extremely clear. NOTE; by default the phone is set at 1080P. You have to go in and adjust it to the highest resolution. The battery power takes a hIt but you can still use ti all day on a full charge and have some power left over. The phone came in a factory sealed box. It is unlocked. However those one flashed a Sprint boot screen when I started it for the first time. Despite this, it recognized my AT&T SIM card without error and I was able to use the phone once everything else was set up. It took a while to download all the necessary updates and security patches, which is to be expected. Also It downloaded two major Android updates. At the end of the second, when the phone rebooted it said something like ""You have changed carrier SIM cards"". At that point it said it was deleting all the previous carrier's (Sprint) specific apps and loaded AT&T apps in their place. This time when the phone rebooted it flashed AT&T boot screen not Sprint.",2019-04-12,positive,5,en,great feature packed phone love phone wait weekend arrive arrived slightly ahead schedule phone great features lot little things notice playing week like checked hearing adjusts phone audio compensate particular hearing deficiencies makes world difference listening earbuds phones supplied earbuds work well little weak bass range otherwise sound clear clean pen fantastic write notes save lock screen already used couple times break habit using fingers everything using pen instead phones screen doesnt need cleaned nearly often depending much use go day day half charges take bit longer charge battery bigger previous phone using wireless charging takes little hours nearly dead battery full charge screen extremely clear note default phone set p go adjust highest resolution battery power takes hit still use ti day full charge power left phone came factory sealed box unlocked however one flashed sprint boot screen started first time despite recognized att sim card without error able use phone everything else set took download necessary updates security patches expected also downloaded two major android updates end second phone rebooted said something like changed carrier sim cards point said deleting previous carriers sprint specific apps loaded att apps place time phone rebooted flashed att boot screen sprint,2,2

samsung,"Bought for Dual SIM: Got a Great Overall Phone. I did about a month of research prior to purchasing this phone. Comparing online the Samsung S8/S9/S10 and other brands from China. Seeing that I have owned Samsung from the S3 I am partial to the brand as it has always done well for me. I needed a phone in the US to function with two SIM cards simultaneously, one for work one for home, without having two completely different cell phones. I should also say, that I was not interested in an Apple Device. The carrier that both of my SIM cards uses is ATT. At the time of purchase, ATT does not carry a Samsung device in the US that offers a dual SIM capability. In the Box (factory sealed with intact seal): - Galaxy S10 (SM-G973F) - AKG wired headphones w/mic - US wall plug w/USB C cord (charger) - Pre-installed screen protector (brand unknown as it was already on the phone) - Clear plastic case (brand unknown, and offers minimal protection) - 128GB SD Card (not able to use internal to the phone due to my need for 2 seperate SIM cards) - USB C Male to standard USB female adapter (use for data transfer and/or keyboard/mouse capabilities) - Informational material specific to the phone - Internal SIM card holder with dual functionality (Can hold 2 micro SIM Cards or 1 micro SIM and one SD Card) Initial power on and setup: - Battery was 50% +/- charged - Initial power up was in another language, however a drop down menu on the initial screen offered English (Canada). This option was selected and found to be what as needed for proceeding with US setup - Effortless data transfer from Samsung S8 to S10 using Samsung Smart Switch. - The ATT SIM card was plug and play, no additional setup was needed other than inserting the SIM into the phone. Initial impressions/functions of S10: - Dual SIM capability (yes, both are physical SIM cards (no eSIM) - Wireless charging (Yes) - Headphone jack (Yes) - 3 main rear cameras and 1 front camera (all function very well) - Hidden fingerprint scanner (works well) - Facial recognition (works really well, I no longer need to use my fingerprint unless I am in very low light conditions) - Bixby, (another ""helper"" akin to Alexa, Google, etc. I was never really a fan of my phone talking to me, so this will probably be more of a toy than a feature for me personally. However, there is a dedicated button on the left hand side for Bixby. This button can be customized with a tap or double tap for an additional quick launch of an app. I chose a single tap for my camera. - Other interesting, helpful, gimmicky, etc function on the phone. Some are great and add well to the phone. Others, I simply disabled or hid. Dual SIM: The real reason I purchased the phone. - I will start by saying that this international version of the S10 was EXACTLY what I was hoping for in a cell phone. - Two separate physical ATT SIM cards are being used. - On the phone screen I am able to see signal strength for both SIM cards - I am able to set a default SIM card for: 1) Phone Calls, 2) Text, 3) Data. This is done easily with a swipe down from the top of the screen and shown directly below the primary settings (such as WiFi, GPS, BlueTooth, etc.) - However, default does not mean that the ""secondary"" SIM is in standby. - When making calls, I am given the option of easily calling from SIM 1 or SIM 2 (which can also be identified with different symbols rather than numbers, such as a home symbol and work symbol). - When texting, I am given the option of easily sending from SIM 1 or SIM 2, same things with the symbols. - When using data, the phone uses the default setting that was chosen by the user. - The phone is able to receive calls for both phone numbers without having to change settings. - All in all, I am very impressed with the intuitiveness of the design, capability, and ease of use with the dual SIM functionality. Overall Impression: With everything from purchase cost, minimal wait time for delivery, setup, use, and functionality I am very impressed. At this time, there is not a single thing about the phone where I would say ""this could be better"". I will say that I am not a gamer, thus the phone will not be used for them. I cannot comment on how well it would be used for games. I do take many pictures than range from people to panoramic vista views of National Parks and the phone is used as my main daily use camera.

samsung,"If only the iPhone had a screen this big!. We have an iPhone 4s, a Galaxy 3 and a Galaxy 4. If you already have a Galaxy 3 I can find little reason to update to the later version. My opinion is that, for most users, if only the iPhone had a big, beautiful screen like the S4 I would stay with Apple hands-down over the Samsung. Why? less complicated to use, better thought-out and engineered ""updates,"" build quality much stronger. In every other way I've seen except for screen size, iPhone blows away the Samsung phones....but that tiny screen on the iPhone is a huge liability for anyone without excellent vision. It also seems to me that for most folks, the endless (and somewhat mindless) menus on the Galaxy phones might be fun for Geeks to play with, but only hugely confusing for the average user. We had AT&T service for years and had no problems with their service, however after my last contract was up I canceled AT&T and went with Consumer Cellular and have had no regrets: same service as AT&T but much MUCH cheaper. The Consumer Cellular Reps I've talked with have also been much more knowledgeable and helpful than the AT&T folks. I have the 3 phones with 15,000 texts, 2 GB data and 2000 anytime minutes for $90/month, at least $50/month less than AT&T....and CC runs on AT&T facilities....check it out....month to month is the only way to go today.",2014-01-19,neutral,3,en,iphone screen big iphone galaxy galaxy already galaxy find little reason update later version opinion users iphone big beautiful screen like would stay apple handsdown samsung less complicated use better thoughtout engineered updates build quality much stronger every way ive seen except screen size iphone blows away samsung phonesbut tiny screen iphone huge liability anyone without excellent vision also seems folks endless somewhat mindless menus galaxy phones might fun geeks play hugely confusing average user att service years problems service however last contract canceled att went consumer cellular regrets service att much much cheaper consumer cellular reps ive talked also much knowledgeable helpful att folks phones texts gb data anytime minutes month least month less attand cc runs att facilitiescheck outmonth month way go today,1,1
samsung,"Hesitant about buying refurbished? Don't let anxiety get the best of you!. Just got this phone today and I'm LOVING it so far! It arrived on time and came with a wall adapter and USB-C charger cable (no SIM card remover tool - fortunately, I had one from my previous phone). Looks and works just like new - there was only a very minor scratch on the back of the phone, but it will be covered up by a case in a few days, so it doesn't matter. This was an upgrade from my Galaxy S7 (also a fantastic phone - the reason I upgraded was because I just wanted something newer, but I couldn't afford a new phone through Verizon). Switching my Verizon SIM card from my S7 to this phone was a seamless process and I had service within seconds, and SmartSwitch moved over my messages and apps quickly. Haven't had the chance to play with all of the bells and whistles yet, but I can say that the camera is awesome! Like so many, I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone through Amazon as opposed to buying a new phone through Verizon (which is all I'd ever done until now), but I took the chance and so far, I have no regrets!

samsung,"Excellent phone, the best Android on the market. Let me preface this review by saying I am a device and tech hound. I am coming from a perfectly good Galaxy S5 and choose to pay full price for an upgrade. It was worth every penny and don't regret the decision one bit. The first thing that grabs you about this phone is the awesome build quality of the phone. This is a first rate device no question. As good as anything the boys from Cupertino can put out. The phone is sleek and has a super high quality feeling in your hand. Not that the S5 was bad but this is like comparing a Toyota to Lexus in terms of materials and fit/finish. As an iPad Air 2 owner I can say this device has a feel just as premium if not more so. The stylus clicks into place with a satisfying sound as well and functions well even though I use an Otterbox. The wireless charging feature also works fine through the Otterbox. Performance, this thing is a beast. Eight cores, 4 GB of ram as much as my 3 year old HP Elitebook might I add. A screen resolution so crisp and clear the colors literally jump out at you. The ability to multi task and run several apps at once is incredible. It blows the doors off the S5 in every performance measure and packs a nice large screen in a relatively small package. I love the 5.7 inch screen size and is notably bigger than the 5.1 on my S5. I considered other 5.5 plus inch phones but kept coming back to the balance of performance and size of the Note 5. If you are on the fence between a small tablet or a large phone this phone is a good compromise. Camera performance is remarkable and the image stabilization is noticeable. Haven't gotten a chance to use the raw mode yet but this is another great feature putting it light years ahead of the competition. The best camera is the one you have on you. This might just be the best one period certainly as good as standard compact digital cameras under 200 dollars. Not as good as a larger sensor enthusiast grade compact or DSLR but impressive in its own right and better than many of the affordable entry level digital cameras today. Performance as phone is excellent too, who would have thought that is what a smart phone is first and foremost a phone. Texting is also a breeze with the built in Samsung messaging app. Speaker phone is appropriately loud as well. Lastly to address the 500 lb elephant in the room is the lack of an SD card and removable battery, I was one of the people morning the loss but thanks to excellent battery performance and the awesome build quality it can be overlooked. Plus with the new USB OTG flash drives you can easily save and back up/transfer information. Thus I was able to go with a pearl white 32 GB model which will be more than enough for me. I considered a wide variety of Android and even the iPhone 6 Plus but nothing came close to the balance of performance and value to what the new Note 5 offers. As of fall 2015 this is the phone that sets the standard and an awesome stylus to jot notes down is a bonus.",2015-09-05,positive,5,en,excellent phone best android market let preface review saying device tech hound coming perfectly good galaxy choose pay full price upgrade worth every penny dont regret decision one bit first thing grabs phone awesome build quality phone first rate device question good anything boys cupertino put phone sleek super high quality feeling hand bad like comparing toyota lexus terms materials fitfinish ipad air owner say device feel premium stylus clicks place satisfying sound well functions well even though use otterbox wireless charging feature also works fine otterbox performance thing beast eight cores gb ram much year old hp elitebook might add screen resolution crisp clear colors literally jump ability multi task run several apps incredible blows doors every performance measure packs nice large screen relatively small package love inch screen size notably bigger considered plus inch phones kept coming back balance performance size note fence small tablet large phone phone good compromise camera performance remarkable image stabilization noticeable havent gotten chance use raw mode yet another great feature putting light years ahead competition best camera one might best one period certainly good standard compact digital cameras dollars good larger sensor enthusiast grade compact dslr impressive right better many affordable entry level digital cameras today performance phone excellent would thought smart phone first foremost phone texting also breeze built samsung messaging app speaker phone appropriately loud well lastly address lb elephant room lack sd card removable battery one people morning loss thanks excellent battery performance awesome build quality overlooked plus new usb otg flash drives easily save back uptransfer information thus able go pearl white gb model enough considered wide variety android even iphone plus nothing came close balance performance value new note offers fall phone sets standard awesome stylus jot notes bonus,2,2
samsung,"Excellent Customer Service. So, I ordered this item and it arrived in time. However, I realized the battery drained pretty very fast even though it was a new phone. So I contacted the seller and he gave a choice to return or have it replaced. I told him I didn't have a phone to use in the mean time if I opted for replacement. John was very nice to send me a replacement, trusting I'll keep my word to send the original one I ordered. Amazingly he sent me a replacement in the mail on Friday and I received it Monday morning. I was so impressed he kept his word, so I switch the phone over to the new one and sent him the one I had ordered initially. I somehow hoped this battery will indeed be better than the last and indeed it is. I'm super glad I got my Note 5 from this seller. I'm currently listening to music on my phone and have been for the past 2hrs plus and my battery has only gone down 7%. I'm really very impressed. I totally recommend this seller and if I ever have to buy another Samsung phone in the future, I'll surely go with them.

He simply has learned how to hold the phone so he doesn't push that button anymore. I love this phone so much, I'm getting one of my own. I am in the horse barn quite a bit and want a phone that will be okay if it gets dropped in a water trough or horse stall. The puppy has even had a go at this phone and it's been great.

samsung,"I917 : experience & suggestions. Two I917 purchases -- first one defective, inaudible ear volume. I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness. Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new. To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive. Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone. Of contacting Samsung: dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise. Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal. You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search). If these two corrections fail you're at the point of sending the phone in for repair or returning to seller. If you do need to contact Samsung, I found Facebook easier than web site contact. Twitter is also an option. Sept. 2016 update: I'm getting ready to upgrade from the i917. The phone has held up with no problems. It pretty much comes down to your ability to live with the Windows system and apps. I've noted some apps available in android and Apple are not available for Windows phones.",2012-05-02,positive,4,en,experience suggestions two purchases first one defective inaudible ear volume online checking unable determine celltoear volume specific model weakness three points ordering experience check vendors return policy purchasing receive order check phone properties firstits easy become enchanted smartphones point overlooking basic ear use buyers reflect liklihood unlocked cell listed actually new date ive found second phone sleek windows system impressive apps increasingly available diverse walled garden iphone contacting samsung dealing customer support samsung aware likely interact repworking scriptwho cellular expertise check manual carefully entering customer service ordeal youll directed two corrections soft reset problem remains hard reset find model via web search two corrections fail youre point sending phone repair returning seller need contact samsung found facebook easier web site contact twitter also option sept update im getting ready upgrade phone held problems pretty much comes ability live windows system apps ive noted apps available android apple available windows phones,2,0

samsung,"Awesome Phone. Cell phones are huge in the world today, theyâre used continuously throughout the day for anything to taking pictures to checking an email. If youâre someone who uses their phone continuously throughout the day then the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is an excellent choice for you. From personal experience I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, itâs by far my favorite phone and I have had no problems with it. Screen Size The Galaxy Note 3 is a huge phone at 5.7 inches, the phone is considered a âphabletâ?or phone-tablet. I was worried I wouldnât like a large phone, but after owning this phone I will never go back to a smaller screen, I absolutely love the screen size. The screen is great for playing games, it makes pictures look amazing, and everything is so much easier to read. Features The Galaxy Note 3 has a 13 mega-pixel camera that is very impressive, every picture is clean and crisp and they look great on the huge screen. It also comes with a stylus or S pen, the S pen is extremely handy to use. Using the pen you can write notes, create e-mails or messages, and you can open multiple apps simultaneously. Overall The only downfall to this phone is the aluminum trim around the outside of the screen dents really easy if you drop it. But there are so many phone cases you can buy that look great and protect the phone from denting like this so it isnât really a problem. Because this phone is large, it has a large 3200 mAh lithium ion battery which lasts all day, so you can stream videos or play games for hours and the battery lasts. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a fantastic phone, itâs by far the best phone Iâve ever owned and itâs also very reasonably priced. Itâs definitely not a top dollar phone, but it performs like one. I would recommend this phone to everyone that uses their phone a lot throughout the day, itâs easy to use the battery life is great, and itâs a very high quality cell phone.",2015-09-25,positive,5,en,awesome phone cell phones huge world today theyare used continuously throughout day anything taking pictures checking email youare someone uses phone continuously throughout day samsung galaxy note excellent choice personal experience would highly recommend samsung galaxy note itas far favorite phone problems screen size galaxy note huge phone inches phone considered aphabletaor phonetablet worried wouldnat like large phone owning phone never go back smaller screen absolutely love screen size screen great playing games makes pictures look amazing everything much easier read features galaxy note megapixel camera impressive every picture clean crisp look great huge screen also comes stylus pen pen extremely handy use using pen write notes create emails messages open multiple apps simultaneously overall downfall phone aluminum trim around outside screen dents really easy drop many phone cases buy look great protect phone denting like isnat really problem phone large large mah lithium ion battery lasts day stream videos play games hours battery lasts samsung galaxy note fantastic phone itas far best phone iave ever owned itas also reasonably priced itas definitely top dollar phone performs like one would recommend phone everyone uses phone lot throughout day itas easy use battery life great itas high quality cell phone,2,2

samsung,"Comparable to Note 9. I purchased this phone after using a Note 9 for the last 3 or so months and it is very comparable to the Note. Obviously missing some features like wireless charging and IP rating(waterproof). If you can get over not having those few things then this is a great phone for you. It's quick, nice looking, huge display screen, and still slim. Comparing to the Note 9, the A70 loads apps about a second slower(not a big deal). The screen display looks just as nice as the Note 10 that my wife has. The camera obviously isn't as good as the Note 9 or 10 and even my son's iPhone 11 but it does the job. The wide angle lens is fun to play around with while taking pics. The super fast charging it comes with is a nice touch and definitely works as stated, charged from 18% to 94% in about 45 mins. I wanted a phone that felt like the Note 9(which I really liked) but not the price. The Note was just a loaner so I had to give that back. I decided to take a chance on the A70 and I'm glad I did. And the seller threw in a 128gig SD card which was nice. I would not hesitate to purchase this phone. The fingerprint scanner is not as good as the Note phones but the face ID is exactly the same. The Fingerprint scanner is hit or miss. Works roughly 65% of the time. My brother owns a One Plus 7 and this phone is just as good as that one for about 200 less and much less than the Note 10 or even the Note 9. I use Tmobile with no service issues at all so far.

samsung,"Worst purchase I've ever made. Okay so before I start, don't get me wrong that the Galaxy Note 5 is an excellent device by it's own right. Still one of the best kept Samsung devices on the market, even as it's approaching three years old. Unfortunately, the device I received from ARIGINALL wasn't exactly that. To start off, some background. I originally purchased this Note 5 after my Galaxy S5 slowed down to the point where it was practically unusable. I figured it was time for a new device, and this one was listed as ""new"", so that's what I picked up. When I first received the device, it didn't take long to start noticing flaws. Little things like the tip of the S Pen being oddly loose, or the font on the packaging being a little off. Needless to say, this was clearly a refurbished product. One of the big things I noticed right off the bat was the camera ""glass"" was actually plastic. I noticed it had scratched up in my pocket, and I ran a penny across the edge to test it. Sure enough, it left a deep scratch where the penny touched it. This should not occur with glass; I even compared it to the lens on my Galaxy S5 just to verify and sure enough, no mark there. The next major issue was the S Pen completely stopped functioning. Mind you this was a little less than a week after I received the device. I figured it wasn't a massive deal, and that I'd go out and get a replacement eventually. I honestly should have sent the device back right then and there, but I didn't have another phone to use while I went through the return process (which I desperately needed for work). So I just held onto it. Then the screen cracked. No I didn't drop it, or slam it, or even scratch it. I accidentally dinged it with the micro USB end of my charger. That was apparently enough to send a crack down the side of this apparently ""new"" device. I contacted ARIGINALL, and they did respond, offering to refund me. I was hoping they'd simply replace the product, as I wanted to reduce the time that I'd go without the device to as little as possible. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't do that. Idiot me thought that again, I'd just live with a cracked screen, because I really needed the device. That was probably the dumbest move I made throughout the whole process. But dare I say that wouldn't be the last of the issues. About two months later (far passed the 30 day return period), the screen started ""bleeding"" purple out of the cracks in the display (see attached photographs). It started off as a small dot, but eventually spread to cover the entire screen. At this point the device was unusable. Luckily I had the wit to plug it into my computer before the screen completely died and back up all the files, but really now it was just an expensive paperweight. By now it was far passed the return date, but I contacted them just to try. They never replied to my email. I probably couldn't have returned it anyway, as my brother had thrown out the box it shipped in. I was forced to go back to the S5, as I was out of options. Since then I've lost the Note 5 somewhere to the void of my closet, and am currently saving up again for a new phone. This time I won't make the mistake of buying from third party sellers.",2018-03-19,negative,1,en,worst purchase ive ever made okay start dont get wrong galaxy note excellent device right still one best kept samsung devices market even approaching three years old unfortunately device received ariginall wasnt exactly start background originally purchased note galaxy slowed point practically unusable figured time new device one listed new thats picked first received device didnt take long start noticing flaws little things like tip pen oddly loose font packaging little needless say clearly refurbished product one big things noticed right bat camera glass actually plastic noticed scratched pocket ran penny across edge test sure enough left deep scratch penny touched occur glass even compared lens galaxy verify sure enough mark next major issue pen completely stopped functioning mind little less week received device figured wasnt massive deal id go get replacement eventually honestly sent device back right didnt another phone use went return process desperately needed work held onto screen cracked didnt drop slam even scratch accidentally dinged micro usb end charger apparently enough send crack side apparently new device contacted ariginall respond offering refund hoping theyd simply replace product wanted reduce time id go without device little possible unfortunately said couldnt idiot thought id live cracked screen really needed device probably dumbest move made throughout whole process dare say wouldnt last issues two months later far passed day return period screen started bleeding purple cracks display see attached photographs started small dot eventually spread cover entire screen point device unusable luckily wit plug computer screen completely died back files really expensive paperweight far passed return date contacted try never replied email probably couldnt returned anyway brother thrown box shipped forced go back options since ive lost note somewhere void closet currently saving new phone time wont make mistake buying third party sellers,0,0

Maybe this is OK for what I need, but the first review that pops up for this phone says it is LTE. well, it isn't. it's 3G folks. My phone was new. It was made in Vietnam apparently. I am on Tmobile and was upgrading from a Galaxy S3 that was having some problems after 3 years. For the price savings (<$300) I can live with 3G. The good thing though is so far the phone reception is amazing. my previous phones have all dropped calls all the time and given distorted call quality. So far this phone is flawless as a phone. I noticed the WIFI calling feature is missing on my phone. This sucks. being able to just click a button and use WIFI for a free and perfect call in low reception area was a great feature on my S3. it is not on this phone unfortunately. I use Gmail for my contacts, so they came up automatically on the new phone once I gave it my gmail address. Then I used the samsung free smartswitch app to move everything else. Just leave the simcard in the old phone, download the app on the old phone, then connect the new phone to a WIFI and download the same app from the playstore. Then just open the app on both phones, place them adjacent to each other and tell both phones the orginal phone is an android then hit send on the old phone. 20 minutes later and the transfer is completed. Then just move the sim card and you are all done. the only thing that did not transfer is my Notes Lite app. not sure why, but it didn't. Oh, the charger that came with it is an international 2 round prong type plug, so that is useless in the USA. But I already had a dozen chargers so not an issue for me.

samsung,"S8 to S10 upgrade review. I broke my S8 a couple weeks ago, which was very disappointing because I loved that phone and was expecting to use it for another two years at least. The S10, however, is essentially the S8 but better. The OS is snappier and more responsive, which I never knew I wanted from the S8. The finger print scanner is on the front now, which I have mixed feelings on and think I preferred the rear scanner. The Samsung *swipe up to get mad* wallet feature is gone, which is nice. Android Auto is actually significantly better, with improved performance and a redesigned interface. And that's pretty much all I have noticed that is different from the two models. I can't confidently say that this phone is a 700$ upgrade from the S8 when half of the improvements are simply removing Samsung bloat that shouldn't have been there in the first place. But for someone coming from an iPhone or buying a phone from scratch, this is a great choice. I'm giving this 5 stars because the S8 was a near perfect phone for me (save for the bloat), and the S10 sticks closely to the same formula.",2019-09-23,positive,5,en,upgrade review broke couple weeks ago disappointing loved phone expecting use another two years least however essentially better os snappier responsive never knew wanted finger print scanner front mixed feelings think preferred rear scanner samsung swipe get mad wallet feature gone nice android auto actually significantly better improved performance redesigned interface thats pretty much noticed different two models cant confidently say phone upgrade half improvements simply removing samsung bloat shouldnt first place someone coming iphone buying phone scratch great choice im giving stars near perfect phone save bloat sticks closely formula,2,2

samsung,"Powerful, feature-rich, quality phone. Overall experience has been good since I purchased it in late November. I use it a lot for general web browsing and email. I was a little anxious about TouchWiz with all the negative comments in press reviews but I don't find anything wrong with it (coming from htc evo 4g). Battery life has been fantastic compared to my old phone. I can go days without charging and the charger is very fast. The email app seems to work well with S/MIME email which my old phone didn't. I've toyed with the SPen some and think it will be useful with a little practice. I still use a Daytimer at work and wonder if this can replace it. Love the ability to cut and paste images and take screen shots. The ability to hand write notes should make shopping lists and memos very convenient. The SPen accessory kit was missing from the box so I'm a bit miffed about that. The phone size is good for me. Fits in my pocket fine. I can dial the phone and other basic stuff with one hand (I'm 6'1 male). I usually use two hands for email, web browsing, messaging, etc but I would on any size phone. People tell me it sounds better than my old phone. I find the white one quite classy in appearance and the build quality seems good. Unlike some press reviews, I wouldn't call it cheesy at all, plastic back or not. And its a lot nicer than a certain new fruit product which I find slippery as ice.

I live in Hawaii and do a lot of swimming and hiking and... well I live in Hawaii there's going to be a multitude of picture taking. The high resolution screen is great. Colors really pop. The battery life is pretty good, I use my phone a lot at work and throughout the day. 10 - 12 hours later it needs to be charged, 8 hours if I'm playing music constantly. Also the Kid's corner, I swear it's one of my favorite features, I have a 4.5 year old and let me tell you the Kids Corner was a God send when we had a 9 hour flight. I love the live tiles and being able to personalize my phone more than I could with my iPhone. I've always like the quality of phones Samsung has put out. This is a great phone. The only downfall is that the Windows app store is not up to par with Google Play and the App Store. That's just windows, though.

samsung,"and though the iPhone 4S has some cool features, there are still times when I miss .... (Edited review of my SAMSUNG Convoy 2): 10 Stars would be more appropriate in my opinion. For a time, I switched to an iPhone 4S, and though the iPhone 4S has some cool features, there have been times when I've missed the relatively old-fashioned technology of my old SAMSUNG Convoy 2. Yesterday, I re-activated the phone, and it's still the same great phone I remember. The picture quality isn't as good as that of the iPhone 4S; and at this point in time the Samsung Convoy 2 has a trade-in value of $0, but, in my own case, it serves the purpose for which I originally bought it: Talking to people on the phone, and sending text messages (and an occasional picture or video message); and, there's something to be said for a device that, my own experience, has proven to be both durable and reliable. I can send a message to a maximum of twenty phone numbers, and / or email addresses at one time, which I could not do with my iPhone 4S. I can save drafts if I need to wait until another time to finish a message, which wasn't an option with the iPhone 4S. With the iPhone 4S, I had to compose and send one message before I could send another one, or I had to cancel sending one message if I wanted to send a separate message, because I knew of no options for saving drafts on it. I don't know how long my SCH-U660 will be viable for use as my mobile phone (i.e, I don't know if or when Verizon will exclude my phone from their network due to the age of the device), but there's a good chance I will stick with this phone as long as it is not excluded from the network. My contract with them ended on May 21st of this year, and I initially thought I wanted to switch over to Metro PCS; but the phone I ordered came with a SIM Card that I never managed to install, and though I could have taken it to a Metro PCS dealer and gotten help with it, having difficulty getting started, may very well have been a blessing, because it served to make me stop and think about whether I really wanted to have a smartphone ( and more specifically, whether I wanted Google to track everything); and the verdict is that I'm sending the smartphone back and getting a refund. I've also come to appreciate having a phone for which there's no chance that bio-metric information will ever be used as a ""security feature""; which seems to me like an attempt to further invade privacy, and I wouldn't put it past the powers that be, to conspire with tech-manufacturers to track the precise location of every human being and domesticated animal, under the pretense of ""security"". For me, my SAMSUNG Convoy 2 was, and still is the best phone I've ever had, and though I know writing this last part may keep this edition of my review from ever going public, I literally thank the good Lord for opening the door for me to have it, and to use it as my current mobile phone.",2014-12-03,positive,5,en,though iphone cool features still times miss edited review samsung convoy stars would appropriate opinion time switched iphone though iphone cool features times ive missed relatively oldfashioned technology old samsung convoy yesterday reactivated phone still great phone remember picture quality isnt good iphone point time samsung convoy tradein value case serves purpose originally bought talking people phone sending text messages occasional picture video message theres something said device experience proven durable reliable send message maximum twenty phone numbers email addresses one time could iphone save drafts need wait another time finish message wasnt option iphone iphone compose send one message could send another one cancel sending one message wanted send separate message knew options saving drafts dont know long schu viable use mobile phone ie dont know verizon exclude phone network due age device theres good chance stick phone long excluded network contract ended may st year initially thought wanted switch metro pcs phone ordered came sim card never managed install though could taken metro pcs dealer gotten help difficulty getting started may well blessing served make stop think whether really wanted smartphone specifically whether wanted google track everything verdict im sending smartphone back getting refund ive also come appreciate phone theres chance biometric information ever used security feature seems like attempt invade privacy wouldnt put past powers conspire techmanufacturers track precise location every human domesticated animal pretense security samsung convoy still best phone ive ever though know writing last part may keep edition review ever going public literally thank good lord opening door use current mobile phone,2,2

samsung,"Would you like to spend 40 Minutes waiting for a phone with lots of battery left to turn on?. If so, here you go. No, that is not an exaggeration. You see, a few months into ownership, this phone would prompt you to turn it off Randomly, without any contact to the power button. Sometimes while you aren't doing anything. Sometimes while the screen is locked. Reject it/Swiping away cause it to stall. Turning it off results in the same lack of turning on. Sure, you'll be able to turn it on. But it crashes before actually turning on. If you take the battery out, and put it back in, it will immediately start trying to turn on. It should not do this. When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on. Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run. When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality. You need those to do just about everything. You can hold the back arrow to access previous things you've been doing, but not while connected. you'll only get a single press. and then you have to wait 5 seconds to get another.

You can only get that message shortcut if you do it RIGHT THEN. if you don't, you have to the app. but then with the time it takes you to get back to Netflix, you have another text.

samsung,"Don't buy this smart phone if you want to use it as a smart phone. I cannot recommend any other uses, though.. This is, by far, the worst smart phone I've owned (almost ten, second Samsung). Its blutooth pairing is completely unreliable and --worst of all-- its interface is incredibly slow and unresponsive. I touch the screen and nothing happens: is it because the app is bogged down or did the phone not register the touch? WAIT AND SEE! I know it's the phone because I have the exact same experience with the two bottom touch buttons and with the only physical press-down button. My normal experience is a 2-5 second delay responding to a major action like launching, closing, or switching between an app. Apps that worked just fine on my last two phones now crash or freeze. Once in a while the phone notices the app is not responding but, more often I'm the one that has to notice and take action, which segues nicely into my next complaint. I have to reboot this phone constantly. Phone stops responding in an app and won't close/switch apps? REBOOT. Phone experiences network blip? REBOOT. Phone can't talk to an already-paired blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone can't detect a new blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone is on? REBOOT. It's like a Windows computer from before, uh, well, probably still. The pre-loaded ROM has annoying problems but someone who likes the phone could fix that with minimal effort so I'm not getting into them beyond noting they exist. It gets two stars because it turns on and performs basic functions, however poorly. I'm considering it a bad mistake and am looking into replacing it and just eating the purchase price. Yes, it's that bad. I like to donate old phones to Cell Phones for Soldiers, but donating this would seem like a bad prank. I will probably go Office Space on it when I pick a replacement. PC LOAD LETTER THIS, SAMSUNG. I should note, for context, my favorite smart phone was a Samsung. No other phone has matched it.

samsung,"The future is in your pocket. Let's get this out of the way: It's expensive, I bought the 512GB version (for the 8gb ram); For all of that expense, I wish Samsung would just let us have the choice of what to do with the Bixbi button out of the box instead of having to download BxActions to remap it. Samsung already has our money, funneling customers right into the Samsung revenue stream just seems greedy. Having said all that, none of that is insurmountable, just mildly annoying. I've given a lot of the Samsung software features a chance and to be honest there's more to like than dislike. Launcher: I really miss the Google Feed from my Pixel XL and getting out of the habit of sliding over to the left to access it is tough to break; I just remapped (with BxActions) my Bixbi key to the Google Feed, but am using the Samsung launcher with a nice dark theme. The app drawer, the Samsung calendar, homescreens, all are very nice and smooth. Edge Apps: I just discovered today that you can use the Edge launcher app to have an easily-accessible home row of apps without having to dump out the Home Screen from whatever app you're in to launch into another app. Gallery: The editing features built into the Gallery app is top-notch and pretty easy to use. S-Pen: This is the reason you buy a Note, and this version of the S-Pen is the best yet; Screen Off-Memo and the accompanying Samsung Notes application is so natural and instinctive to use; Yank out the S-Pen while the screen is off and start writing, everything is auto-saved; gorgeous! Keyboard: I didn't think anything topped the G-Board, but with a little bit of tweaking to your liking, the Samsung keyboard is phenomenal; I find that it's far smarter to suggest common words that Gboard, has a nice floating keyboard option for games, and when you pull out your S-Pen, it flips to a very capable handwriting interface...I've started using this to take notes which are quickly and accurately transcribed into text in any app. The camera is fast and competent, with LOTS of features...If you spend a lot of time in the camera tweaking settings, this will keep you occupied for a while. Finally there's Dex mode, which I've found to be JUST ABOUT as good a replacement for a desktop machine. Google Docs and Office 365 are present and accounted for and work well, the Chrome browser switches to a tabbed mode in Dex mode, and multi-tasking is adequate, but not perfect. You can even play games with mouse and keyboard! It's not PERFECT, of course, you're still running mobile apps, some of which refuse to play nice on a desktop setting, but they work well for the most part, and for my use cases, fulfills 90% of what I need a home desktop for. I haven't tried any series IDE work or video editing with Dex, but the apps are there, ready to be used. All of this great stuff is wrapped up in a beautiful metal-and-glass package with battery life that lasts all day, a beautiful 6.5"" 1440p screen with the deepest possible blacks and bright, vibrant colors, and stereo speakers that pack a punch in such a small package.

samsung,"Mediocre. Glitchy. Poor performance.. I'll start off by saying I've always been a huge Samsung fan. I've always owned Galaxy Notes and with the the Note 7 fiasco I had to settle for this phone. First off the edge is annoying. It's nothing but a gimmick and I don't understand why samsung insists on using the edge screens on their devices. It gets annoying at times if you have to click on something that is on the edge. I chose the edge because it had a slightly bigger battery. This phone is mediocre at best and I don't understand the rave reviews it has gotten. Battery life on this phone is garbage. I repeatedly close all my apps and use the battery saver function but it still has different battery life every day. For example, one day the battery life will be good then the next three days it will be utter garbage. I've tried to find a pattern in my usage to trace why its like this but I can't find anything. Bottom line is the battery does weird things. The phone is super glitchy. It constantly freezes and apps have to be restarted. Not sure if its android itself or the phone. This is my greatest complaint. I'm fed up with this phone. I'm almost to the point of trading for an iPhone but I will more than likely wait until the end of the year to see whats in store.

samsung,"Great budget phone for the price. Okay so let's get down to the brass tax and get straight to the point. For a budget phone this is an awesome phone but honestly Samsung is rolling their A series with a slight screen defect. Now I know there is an obvious firmware issue with most of them and it can be a simple fix but for free starting holding the power down and volume down rocker button and making sure that you have plenty of charge on your battery so you can revive your supposed black screen problem. I am sure most of the time that's all the issue is in my case I was the one unlucky individual who received one brand new out of the package device that worked perfectly for 24 hours then failed having a black screen of death that could not be resolved through this simple restart. I'm not saying this is not a good phone because it is you just have to be mindful that if you are one of those individuals who receive one and it doesn't work you might get lucky knowing that it might just be the firmware issue, if not then you're the very unlucky one and it gets a defective screen where there's nothing you can do other than send it back hoping for a good replacement A series phone. Don't let my review stop you from buying one Samsung is a really good brand and you have to remember they're pushing out phones quicker than we can count so something's bound to go wrong somewhere and Amazon in my opinion is your greatest option when buying a new phone as long as its under prime protection so that if you are the unlucky and unfortunate individual Amazon has your back. So with that said the only thing you have to worry about it's possibly getting one that rolls out the bad screen otherwise I would have submitted a 5-star review.

samsung,"Samsung S8+ Review. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a smart choice for a smartphone. This phone serves all the purposes you would expect in a modern smartphone and does so tremendously well. With a 3500 mAh battery, it lasts all day displaying all your information, entertainment, and communication needs on a beautiful edge to edge screen with a 6.2ââ?Quad HD+ Super AMOLED technology with a easy to use UI (user Interface). As someone, who has been on #teamiPhone for the last 5 years making the switch was not an easy choice but after analyzing the market and realizing that now in the Fall of 2017 is the perfect time to switch markets. I switched markets and I am enjoying the S8 + more than I ever did a new generation iPhone. After letting my mom (a baby boomer) play with this new phone, it became quite clear that she could operate it with about the same level of competency as her iPhone 6+ running the latest OS. Granted, there is a steeper learning curve for older generations with newer technologiesâ?I think it is safe to say that anyone at any age could operate the S8+ with ease and learn to enjoy life on the other side of the smartphone market.

samsung,"Great Phone and a Good Deal. Great phone! I ordered in black color. I've been using it heavily for two weeks now. The phone I received was unlocked and had the latest Android OS loaded with no carrier branding or apps installed (I'm talking totally clean OS with no bloat-ware apps) which is fantastic. The phone itself is in seemingly perfect condition with no obvious signs of wear or scratches. As mentioned above, I've been using it now for two weeks and the battery has proven to hold a charge perfectly and no hardware or software issues have surfaced. It came in a generic box with cheap, no-name, generic low wattage charger and short three foot USB-C cable. I'm ok with that given the phone itself was perfect and it had a truly clean OS build installed. My only complaint would be that the price of this phone went from $439 that I paid for it two weeks ago to today when I just checked and it is now reduced to just $400. So I got pinched for $39 for buying two weeks early it seems. I'd love it if the vendor refunded me but that $39 but it's not Amazon so I'm probably out of luck with wishing for that to happen.

samsung,"Beautiful phone, perfect size, powerful hardware - but unreliable and glitchy (may be due to SD card incompatibility?). I had been really happy with my Moto X Pure for several months, but I wasn't crazy about how big it was - so I decided to downsize with the S7 after seeing all the glowing reviews. The S7 is indeed the perfect size for a phone; my slightly smaller than average (for a guy) hands can reach everything with one had, and the glass body is beautiful to look at and to hold. The features are great too - good battery life, fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, Samsung Pay (so you can pay via NFC or using conventional card readers), nice cameras, super-bright flashlight, even a pedometer! The Samsung Touchwiz software is an unnecessary departure from standard Android but mostly it just looks a bit different and doesn't really do anything cool or new except for a bunch of semi-useless bells and whistles (although I really like that it lets you prevent certain notifications from appearing on the lock screen - my other Moto phone with standard Android can't do that). The first two days I used the phone (no joke) it got 5 (that's five) system updates from Verizon - and it never worked right after that. The first sign of trouble was when it unexpectedly restarted in the middle of me using an app. Then every time after that, after rebooting, it would show the message ""The process system isn't responding, do you want to close it?"", and whether I chose ""Wait"" or ""OK"", the phone would be laggy, get warm, have trouble getting a signal, and fail to finish uninstalling any apps. After a little online research, I decided to boot into recovery mode and clear the system cache - but that didn't help; neither did starting it in Safe Mode. Then I tried a couple of different apps to clear individual app's cache, but oddly they would just get stuck while scanning. Finally I tried the nuclear option, and did a factory reset. That seemed to do the trick, but once I had reinstalled all of my usual apps (that all work fine on my Moto X Pure), the ""Process system isn't responding"" error came back. So I returned the phone. Maybe I just had a lemon, or maybe it was a bug in one of the software updates; I commend Samsung/Verizon for issuing updates frequently, but the more frequent updates are, the less time there is to test them, and I wonder if they've been taking shortcuts that let bugs slip through. P.S. It's worth mentioning, though everyone already knows and complains about it, that Samsung and Verizon stuff these phones full of bloatware and redundant apps that you mostly can't uninstall.

samsung,"so much better. I have had nothing but great luck and service with these certified refurbs. This is my 9th or 10th one. Always great quality and outstanding service.. This phone had some issues with arrival as FedEx refused to deliver at a time when I was home. I finally worked it out but all I can say is the FedEx is by far the worst delivery service on the face of the earth. That being said the phone is wonderful. I am replacing a S7 so I wasn't expecting much difference. My S7 and I really didn't get along great and I often had funny software quirks that would change settings on me without my permission. Ithe took me a while but I had finally gotten it to a point where I was controlling the phone and not the other way around. I was worried that this phone would be the same way (we have another S7 in the family that behaves as it should). Push came to shove and I had to either leave Samsung or get another S7 (someone else on the plan needed a phone and mine was nominated lol) Well this phone has been amazing, It is so easy to use and setup was not a struggle as the transfer was seamless and easy. All my hard work getting the other S7 to behave transferred over and this phone is a dream. The software runs fast and reminds me of the early days of Android (original Motorola Droid user here!) with the easy customization available. The screen is amazing and looks so elegant with those smooth curved edges. THe edge swipe tray is an amazing feature and I am so in love with how it works. I like a very uncluttered home screen and that edge tray just makes it so easy to keep a nice tidy screen without having to dig around for commonly used apps. Samsung has a winner with this and I won't have a none edge phone again. Battery life is slightly better than S7 (larger battery) I get a full days use (moderate to heavy) on a single charge but when I go to bed the phone is screaming for juice (usually 10 to 15% left). Phone is so thin and easy to hold I really am debating about putting a case on it (I will as Im a klutz but man is the naked phone georgeous). My only real complaints are the same as the S7. Micro USB charging is so outdated. The wireless charging in g is spotty at best (you need perfect alignment on the base). the power on and volume buttons are too low on the case and I grab them all the time (even after having over a year on the regular S7). The bloatware is a little more manageable on this phone and I was able to delete some junk I won't use and disable a bunch also, but Samsung (and Verizon) put too much redundant garbage on these phones. SD and Sim card slot is a pain to use and the non replaceable battery should be outlawed as this is building a forced replacement into the phone and that should be illegal.

samsung,"I give this phone five stars. Great screen, great processor, great software. This camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. If you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the Samsung SA plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluation I got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. That person has one basic need. To send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. I have the exact same phone but I have the note 8. I think the note 8 is the absolute best phone I've ever had. I use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. I also use the pen to edit the pictures and I have multiple photo editing programs. They require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work. If you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. Apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone. Android on this phone works great. Yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. Bixby is a absolute pain and the Bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. I downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. Unfortunately, Samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the Bixby button. Fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that Samsung seems to interfere with the app function. In the last year I've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the O LED screen is awesome. I read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. I've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. I understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. Unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock. And, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. I have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. Take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phone In my experience, this phone is five stars.

samsung,"Probably my last samsung device. I have been using Samsung phones for years now. I have had the original galaxy s phone, a couple S3s, an S4, a couple S5s, a Note edge, a note 7, and now a note 8. I think this will be my last phone from them. Heres why: First of all, let me start with some good things. It is a big phone which I like and the cameras on it take absolutely wonderful photos. Its specs also make it handle a fair amount without stuttering or lagging which is nice. Its also a great looking phone. One thing to note, the phone uses gorilla glass 5 which scratches super easily so be careful. Here is why i took off 3 stars. First star was for the fingerprint reader. While I was hoping the rumors of an under-display reader were true, I wasnt actually expecting it. However, I also was not expecting samsung to place the reader in the worst spot imaginable. The fingerprint reader is located to the right of the camera. However the camera is so high up on the back of the phone that holding the device in a comfortable way means you cannot reach the reader unless your fingers are abnormally long. I am not just saying this. I do mean abnormally. I am a tall guy with big hands. I can't reach it. The other issue is for right handed people, you'll have to cross the cameras with your finger to reach the reader. This means youll be smudging your camera every time you want to attempt to unlock your phone. For all intents and purposes, this phone does not have a fingerprint scanner. Star number 2 is for the forced features. Samsung has started adding a button on the phone which triggers their voice assistant, Bixby. Unfortunately, you can not change this or even disable it which means every time you press it, it brings up bixby. You can't have it bring up the google assistant, nor can you turn it off completely.Why would you want to turn it off completely? Well the button is the perfect height to be pressed when the phone is in your cupholder or if its placed down sideways on the wireless charging stand. Another ""feature"" that bothers me is if you are using google search and you click on a link it opens it in its own little browser but if you want to do more, you have to open it in a proper browser app. Normally the google app has an option ""Open in Chrome"" Here the option is ""Open in Samsung Internet"". You can't change this. For anyone who wants to use chrome, youre basically being forced in that situation to use samsung's browser. There is also the fact that the bootloader is locked on the qualcomm versions but that doesn't apply to most consumers so it did not really affect my rating. Finally the third star is for samsung's support. God forbid you ever have to call their support to do anything. When I was trying to return my Note 7 for the recall, they initally told me they had no record of me ever sending my phone in and i wouldnt get any money back. I dug up the UPS receipt and tracking number and they suddenly found the information and were going to mail me a check. Monthly calls to samsung just left me with ""processing status"". I only received my money about 7 months after. Now I had to call in and ask a simple question about a promotion they ran for the note 8. It was about how to trade in an older phone. I called samsung and each person told me to call a different number. I was hung up on twice, and the only time I got anywhere was when I was sent to yet another incorrect department but I asked to speak to the supervisor and he was the only one who actually tried to help. My question still went unanswered because the ""proper department"" wasnt taking any calls...... Final verdict: I would not spend $900 on this phone.

samsung,"So I called Amazon figuring that maybe I just got a bad phone and asked for a replacement. I ordered this phone from a supplier here on Amazon called EMB-Phones thinking that this was a Sprint phone that only needed to be activated. What I got was a small electronic paperweight.

samsung,"probably the overall best of this generation standard upper level windows phone. I own all three of what would probably be considered the main 3 upper level Windows phones of this generation (the 1020 or mini tablet types are probably more niche phones)--the Nokia 925, Samsung Ativ and HTC 8x. Of the three I would probably rate the Samsung as the strongest phone overall (none of them is ""perfect"" IMO). The Samsung wins this accolade in my book by virtue of it's stellar battery life (and it is removable/replaceable as well), the sd slot for increased storage, and it's slightly larger, vibrant screen. Call quality and reception are decent, and it has no problems with being picky about wireless like the 925. It's main handicap is a mediocre camera which shoots in 4:3 rather than the widescreen the Nokia and HTC shoot in, though quality wise the HTC is no better and probably not quite as good as the Samsung. The 925 has a better camera, and the HTC has better call quality and is more comfortable, but they both have fairly poor battery life, the 925 has wireless issues and the HTC's camera isn't great either, so overall the Samsung takes top honors in my book since it only has one shortfall, while the others have more than one (and poor battery life out of the box when the battery can not be replaced is a biggie).",2014-09-16,positive,4,en,probably overall best generation standard upper level windows phone three would probably considered main upper level windows phones generation mini tablet types probably niche phonesthe nokia samsung ativ htc x three would probably rate samsung strongest phone overall none perfect imo samsung wins accolade book virtue stellar battery life removablereplaceable well sd slot increased storage slightly larger vibrant screen call quality reception decent problems picky wireless like main handicap mediocre camera shoots rather widescreen nokia htc shoot though quality wise htc better probably quite good samsung better camera htc better call quality comfortable fairly poor battery life wireless issues htcs camera isnt great either overall samsung takes top honors book since one shortfall others one poor battery life box battery replaced biggie,2,2

This one fell out of my shirt pocket when I leaned over (fell less than 3 feet) and the screen shattered (both the tempered glass protector and the phone glass.) On top of that, Samsung has basically turned into Apple with all of the useless and unwanted apps and notifications and whatnot that they will no longer allow you to remove or disable or turn notifications off for.

samsung,"Horrible Fingerprint Reader, and bad bad bad audio through USBC. I got the Note10+ at [boxstore] last week for a really cheap price out the door with a case. Super deal and I was extremely excited to get it. I used to have a note 4. Really missed the s-pen and when I was due to upgrade was the year the of the Note battery issue. Anyway, I really wanted to like the Note 10+. It is blazing fast. Fast doesn't mean usable. The phone had two major flaws for me so it's out. I think I actually could have lived with it if there were only one out of two of the below flaws, but in the end, I've returned it. These flaws may not be present for you, but they are being talked about and I didn't realize it when I purchased. Flaw 1: But that fingerprint reader on the note 10+ is just abysmal. I tried all the ""hacks""... multiple finger prints, multiple fingers, etc. Nope. It was 40% reliable or worse. You have to position the finger, looking at the big phone... no real muscle memory to hit it... slide on the glass, and the stupid ""press harder"", ""unrecognized"", etc. And when it does finally recognize, it's slooooow compared to my s8+ which is like lightning, 100% reliable every time. I thought maybe I'd wait for a firmware upgrade, but the device has had several, and it's still awful, so IMO it's not getting better. Also Samsung is likely moving away from this technology because it's slow and unreliable, which means they won't invest in optimizing, or they can't. Why did they go to this bad tech? Why didn't they stick with what works? Flaw 2: The use of the USBC for headphones is a terrible experience on the Note 10+. Audio on included ear-buds keeps cutting off after 10 minutes when touching the connection. Which means if it's in your pocket, all the time. If you're working out and it's on a machine that is vibrating, it cuts off, etc. You can read more about my experience I've posted about this issue here. When others chimed in with similar problems I decided OK, this isn't so isolated and likely people just use bluetooth but I'm not going there yet and expect to use what they provided. Other cons I would have been willing to live with: Too big for hands with case: For me, the larger phone and typing, I found was more problematic. My thumbs have to move significantly more distance. Like I said, I would have gotten over this, but just sharing this is pretty huge and I have pretty decently large hands. Voice to text... I don't know if it was a bad mic or what, but my speech to text was much less accurate. No LED status light. i missed it. Samsung should do this in software in the always-on-display. They should code a LED notification. Yes, there is an app in the Google play store. But the way it is implemented it uses more battery (10% a day?) than if Samsung coded into the OS directly. My s8+ just feels ""good"". The Note felt bad. It might have been the case. It might have been the sharp square corners. It might have been the total width. It might be the smooth curved screen of the s8 that I used to wish were flat. I don't know. Screen shots are hard on the Note 10. The power button moved. It's just not as easy. There is no ""discrete checking my phone"" with the note 10 +. Everyone will know you're checking your phone. There are some positives which I mentioned above. I really wanted to get back to using the s-pen. Someone told me to get the Note 9. Maybe I will, but I don't know if it is really faster than the s8+. The ""other cons"" above I would have lived with and eventually gotten used to. Sharing this experience to help others, and I'm sure there are many note 10+ users who are extremely happy.

samsung,"Pretty nice device. So far I definitely like this phone. First thing I noticed is how light it is- there is very little weight, even with the battery in it. It has a lot more surface area than any phone I have ever used, but it's very thin. I can get used to how big it is. Camera quality is very good. Voice command system is pretty neat. Still getting the hang of some of the 'smart' features which monitor your face movement to control the device. Only thing I don't like about it is (and it's not a deal-breaker) that I can't change the sound it makes when tapping the screen. It can be toggles on or off, but not changed. What sold it for me: - Android OS is fast and reliable. - Excellent camera / video quality - Expandable storage space (big deal for me) - Very thin and sleek (i've always been a Motorola Razr fan for this reason) - Fairly inexpensive (with a contract) - Processor is ridiculous (and I mean that in a good way.. it's got a better processor than most tablets) - Wifi - Supposedly good battery (I haven't had it long enough to judge for myself)",2013-10-16,positive,5,en,pretty nice device far definitely like phone first thing noticed light little weight even battery lot surface area phone ever used thin get used big camera quality good voice command system pretty neat still getting hang smart features monitor face movement control device thing dont like dealbreaker cant change sound makes tapping screen toggles changed sold android os fast reliable excellent camera video quality expandable storage space big deal thin sleek ive always motorola razr fan reason fairly inexpensive contract processor ridiculous mean good way got better processor tablets wifi supposedly good battery havent long enough judge,2,2

samsung,"The Last Samsung Product I Will Ever Purchase!. Prior to this terrible warrantee experience I am having I liked Samsung products. I have several in my home. However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck! I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and theyâll fix it. Sounded great, however. I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right? Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, thatâs weird. On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldnât she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast. Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now Iâm irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so whatâs the problem? He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung canât send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor âGrahamâ?will not speak with me and that he doesnât have the capability to send an email either. Now Iâm furious. Iâm being lied to and this is getting really shady. Iâm not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly. I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, thereâs no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament. Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasnât holding my breath at this point. Weâll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and donât know if I will ever get my phone back. Iâm thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I donât get my phone by this Friday.

samsung,"NO WARRANTY despite being a new product. It is a beautiful phone. So, why only one star? Well, because although it is a legit and new phone, it has no warranty from Samsung. After registering the phone on Samsung webpage, and speaking with a Samsung representative for one hour, it seems that most phones sold by third-party sellers on Amazon have no warranty, because they are not from ""authorized sellers"", and therefore NO WARRANTY for me. My wife loved the phone, and it was a birthday present, so I don't plan to return it. If it fails, I will buy another phone (not from Samsung, obviously). But I regret not buying the phone from an ""authorized seller"" for 50 dollars more. But how I was going to know? Up to this moment I didn't know about this absurd Samsung policy regarding totally legit phones. This should be clearly stated in the product details, so I already reported that there is missing information in the page to Amazon. Regarding Samsung... Well, apparently they believe in the free market only when it suits them. But I, on the other hand, believe that consumers should not be penalized because Samsung cannot control its own chain of sales. My opinion is that it is a lousy (and shortsighted) policy. If a company made a product, that company should cover it, regardless of who sells it.

samsung,"I'll probably keep it but.... I don't write many reviews, but since this phone is new to the US market, I thought I would throw my two cents in. I have only had two smartphones since 2016, yep I was a big hold out, and they were both cheap BLU phones, so I don't have much to compare this to. It's more phone than I need, and it's a great phone so far, except for one thing. It has no LED notification light. I didn't know this when I bought it, and I'm struggling. The reason I decided to replace my year and a half old phone is that the notification light constantly flashed for no known reason. I always have sound off, and I'm not always right near my phone, so it's annoying thinking I missed a call or text and checking my phone, I realize it's just a glitch. This phone doesn't tell me I missed a call or message unless I check it. I think that's better, but only slightly. Some people will not be bothered by this, but I only realized this after I bought it, even after reading many reviews. The fingerprint sensor is ok, fails sometimes, and I have no screen protector, but it might fail more often with one. You can use the PIN option as well. It takes pretty good pictures, but again, I can only compare with not so great phones. I thought I would be wowed by this phone after reading all the reviews and coming from a true budget phone, but I'm just on the fence. So essentially my two cents is do a lot of research and make sure this, or any phone, has the features you want, because while this phone is new to the US market and is getting rave reviews, there might be a better phone out there even cheaper.",2019-10-07,neutral,3,en,ill probably keep dont write many reviews since phone new us market thought would throw two cents two smartphones since yep big hold cheap blu phones dont much compare phone need great phone far except one thing led notification light didnt know bought im struggling reason decided replace year half old phone notification light constantly flashed known reason always sound im always right near phone annoying thinking missed call text checking phone realize glitch phone doesnt tell missed call message unless check think thats better slightly people bothered realized bought even reading many reviews fingerprint sensor ok fails sometimes screen protector might fail often one use pin option well takes pretty good pictures compare great phones thought would wowed phone reading reviews coming true budget phone im fence essentially two cents lot research make sure phone features want phone new us market getting rave reviews might better phone even cheaper,1,1

samsung,"Certified Refurbished my from Edge Cellulare. I wish all the reviewers here would put who the phone comes from and refurbished by for guaranty. Depending on how it goes for the next couple of weeks will decide my review. If I decide to keep it, I'm definitely getting the insurance. As I just don't trust it. So here is the issues and the good. After receiving it, it took me 10 days to have enough time to switch out my other phone, which I gave to hubby. (Galaxy Note 5) The note 4 has better review for battery life and I like the SD card slot also. They were not available when I purchased the Note 5 but when hubby needed a new phone I decided to get a ""Certified Refurbished"" phone thinking that it would be comparable to new. Well for visual, it is, screen, and body wise. Once received I had to go from, I have no idea what Android version to 6.0.1 Marshmallow. It had to download/install/restart/install about 4 or 5 times. I had to update the Note 5 too (because I never had) and it took longer as it had 2 years of updates and was 7 download/install/restart/install. So this is a normal process for phones that haven't been updated. Note 5 got the 7.0 Nougat update, which I have to say I dislike all the changes in menus. OK, going on. Everything went swimmingly with the updates and I started to use and install my normally used apps as I need them. I started installing Fandango from Play store and saw Netflix as a suggested app, so while downloading Fandango, I pressed on the link to Netflix. Well screen went black, home button, no response, power button regular push, no response. The phone powered off! No shut down! I thought WTH. So tried a restart by long pushing the power button. The Galaxy Logo would come on then black screen. I waited and waited no Sprint screen. I did this again with same result. I tried a vol-home-power into boot menu and restarting from there (not resetting, just restart) and I got all the way to the Sprint screen, then, black screen and no power. Scary, so I started wondering how much power I had, could this be low power? Well I plugged in the phone and after a number of seconds the power off battery indicator showed 8%. Should be enough to power on and work for a bit. I tried again to just power on, holding the power until power up and... well, it started up. I am seriously wondering if it has a low power issue. There was no battery critically low warning because it never got to the 5% that it needs to get to to do that and it never shut down like it is supposed to do at critical battery. It is not supposed to just pop off. So, it seemed to work fine for a couple of days. Then, again while in Google Play, it just went black screen and was obviously powered down. I knew that it wasn't a battery issue as I had looked not that long before. I decided to check the battery by plugging it in. (Wish I had tried turning it on to see if it would) And it had 68% battery! OK, so I tried to turn it on, which at this point it is plugged in, and it started right back up. Hmm... so plug and power seems to jump start the restart though, to be honest, I didn't try to restart it this time without the plug. Now I have been using it for another few days and have had no issues. Haven't gone to the Google Play store either. I did run out of battery and although I knew it was low, I didn't know it was that low. And it did go into the shut down mode on me in the middle of a game. I plugged it in and had like 0%-1% battery. I didn't get the low battery at 5% that the Note 5 does, shutting the screen down to lower lighting and warning you. Nope, no warning, no light. It did warn me at 20% and the game pulls a lot of power so I knew I needed to plug it in soon but... 20% can go for a long time if you just use the phone as a phone! I really think there is a power issue as it was quicker than I expected too. There are good things about the phone and so far I've had only 2 actual black out power failures (not shut downs) but 2 is two too many. Still the phone is great in function. I love the screen. I actually tested it with Antutu benchmark against the Note 5 and it tested slightly higher, the 5 was 72 thousand something and the Note 4 77 thousand something. They both looked wonderful during the rendering. The sound is slightly better than the Note 5 also. Used and tested, phone audio and mic quality, very good, headset jack good, Bluetooth pairs and works easily, pen detects and functions, Camera and video takes beautiful photos. Wireless and GPS function well too. I love the Note and have had one since the Note 2. I even have a Note Tablet. I am going to use this and maybe try to install a couple of more apps just to see what happens. All the same, this certified refurb. has power issues. Going to research further and see if there is battery contact or other issue that as fixable. If not and it does power off again, it'll be sent back as not working correctly. Hopefully within the 30 day Amazon policy as I don't know what the ""limited"" means on the 90 limited warranty. I think this is specific to my phone so it might not be your experience. Others have had issues with updating, I did not.

samsung,"Awesome phone, but go with the regular S7 to avoid expensive repairs.. Awesome phone. Top-of-the-line processors, display, battery life, etc., and I purchased for only $250 refurb. The one thing I don't like (and perhaps I should have done better research on this exact issue) is the curved edges on the sides of the screen. I like the look and feel of the edges, I just didn't think about how easily those edges cause the screen to break. I've dropped all of my previous phones hundreds of times and none of them ever broke (once a screen went out but it was $30 to replace the screen myself). I had this bad boy one danged day, it slipped out of my pocket when I was getting out of my truck, hit the pavement, and completely busted the screen (screen protector was supposed to arrive the next day). That is annoying, but I would be fine with it since it's my fault the phone fell in the first place, but what I really hated was seeing the what a replacement screen costs in comparison to it's competition. The curved edges of the screen triple the price of it's sister phone's screen, the S7. I'd much rather replace the screen for $70 than for $200 (doing the work myself). The only difference between the S7 and S7 edge that I am aware of (besides the curved screen) is that the S7 Edge has 20% more battery capacity (which is what sold me on the Edge over the S7 since they were about the same price refurb and battery life was exactly why I was in the market for a new phone in the first place).

samsung,"DO NOT BUY - The phone was blacklisted and thus unusable. Will disable your AT&T account entirely.. TLDR: What a nightmare. I tried to upgrade my phone, but instead received a blocked phone and had my original phone disabled for two days. I've bought multiple phones on Amazon before without any issues, but now I understand how low of a bar it is to be ""inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers."" The phone arrived in a timely fashion and booted up just fine. It connected to WiFi and successfully transferred all my apps and info and data from my previous Samsung device. However, after inserting my SIM card, the phone would not send or receive text messages or phone calls. I reviewed and updated the APN settings (which is a common adjustment for phones purchased online), but I had no luck. Eventually, I learned that the phone had been ""blacklisted"" as a lost or stolen phone, meaning it would never work on any carrier. Among all the checking and testing, this nearly-criminal supplier never thought to check the most basic (and essential) functionality of the phone. I am still appalled at the lack of due diligence from a business whose core service involves buying and selling used phones. My next thought was: ""That's why I buy from Amazon - the return policy. I'll just go back to my original phone and all will be well..."" So I pulled my SIM card out and put it back into my original phone. No big deal. But, now the phone I had been using for over a year wouldn't send or receive texts, calls and data. For two whole workdays (during which I rely on my phone for work), I struggled to figure out the issue until I was able to weasel out of work and brought both phones to the local AT&T store. They confirmed that the new phone had, indeed, been blacklisted and would no longer work for anyone on any carrier. Furthermore, they said that when I put my SIM card into the blacklisted phone, AT&T automatically disabled my account and I had to request it to be re-enabled. Unacceptable.

samsung,"Holding Up Nicely. On the whole, I'd have to say that I think this is one of the better Android devices on the market. I've used one from time to time and have helped several family members learn to use them and occasionally do minor trouble shooting for them, and they're really solid devices overall. One of the best things in Samsung's favor is that they take keeping their devices updated pretty seriously. The Galaxy S4 is in the process of being updated to Android 4.4, where some manufacturers seem content to toss an Android device onto the market and then pretend that they have no idea that updates are a thing that should be happening. This will be a less severe issue down the line, because Google is restructuring the operating system a bit to make it easier for them to handle updates themselves rather than leaving a lot of it to the hardware companies, but it's still nice to get something from a company who's serious about their obligation to provide a good experience even after they have your cash in hand. Other than that, this has a lot of nice features. The screen is good enough for just about anyone. It handles opening and running apps at a nice pace. There's a simplified interface that hides a lot of the apps and noise, which can be good for people who find smart phones a tiny bit overwhelming at times. You can use it with a Miracast tv/receiver to mirror the screen on a tv to show off things like photos and videos without asking people to crowd around a tiny screen. The camera is excellent for both photos and videos. The screen is just a bit large for people who put a very high priority on portability and using a phone one-handed. On the other hand, this size is just big enough to be reasonably comfortable for people who struggled with the teensy tiny touch keyboards on the earlier generations of smart phones. Whether you like the way Samsung makes Android look is a matter of personal taste. I like the Google Nexus devices just a little better, but Samsung's approach is a very long way from the worst that you can find on the market. On the whole, while this isn't my personal device of choice, I've been really pleased with them. I tend to be the person providing tech support for my family members, so I've used them many times and I've had the happy experience of not being stuck putting in a ton of time trying to get them to work as they should. I occasionally tweak a setting here or there and do little things like check to make sure everything's been updated properly, but on the whole the Galaxy S4's in my life have been about as close to trouble-free as any piece of electronics I've encountered.",2014-01-15,positive,5,en,holding nicely whole id say think one better android devices market ive used one time time helped several family members learn use occasionally minor trouble shooting theyre really solid devices overall one best things samsungs favor take keeping devices updated pretty seriously galaxy process updated android manufacturers seem content toss android device onto market pretend idea updates thing happening less severe issue line google restructuring operating system bit make easier handle updates rather leaving lot hardware companies still nice get something company whos serious obligation provide good experience even cash hand lot nice features screen good enough anyone handles opening running apps nice pace theres simplified interface hides lot apps noise good people find smart phones tiny bit overwhelming times use miracast tvreceiver mirror screen tv show things like photos videos without asking people crowd around tiny screen camera excellent photos videos screen bit large people put high priority portability using phone onehanded hand size big enough reasonably comfortable people struggled teensy tiny touch keyboards earlier generations smart phones whether like way samsung makes android look matter personal taste like google nexus devices little better samsungs approach long way worst find market whole isnt personal device choice ive really pleased tend person providing tech support family members ive used many times ive happy experience stuck putting ton time trying get work occasionally tweak setting little things like check make sure everythings updated properly whole galaxy ss life close troublefree piece electronics ive encountered,2,2

samsung,"The beginning of a beautiful relationship.. Imagine this: you finally meet your dream girl (or guy). She's so smart - it's like there's nothing she doesn't know how to do. She's pretty - maybe not a supermodel but way prettier than your last girlfriend. She's well-connected. Easy to please. And she WANTS to do everything for you. Except...she makes you feel stupid sometimes. Oh not on purpose, and not all the time...you just find you have trouble communicating. She's got a waaaay higher vocabulary than you. She doesn't always explain things to you - you have to figure it out on your own. She's kinda needy sometimes. She's dainty and you worry she'll get hurt. And her parents...the less you say about them, the better. Still, none of those things are deal-breakers. Far from it, even though she's out of your league, she's so open to whatever you want to do that you forgive the flaws. Because most of time, everything is wonderful, and you can't imagine life without her. That's what owning a Galaxy S4 is like. The S4 is the Swiss Army Knife of phones. It does everything. The only feature it lacks is an FM tuner. Yes, some phones do certain things better. Some are a little faster, some have a little better camera, a little better screen. But the S4 does all things well. The screen is fantastic. The camera is very good. It runs any app you can think of. It has tons of space and has an SD card slot. The battery is swappable. The call quality is pretty good. Samsung's TouchWiz interface, while not as pretty as HTC's, is more pure Android than others and it's functional and flexible. It has more sensors than you knew you needed. Accessories are easy to find because this phone is so popular - and there's a reason for that. It's a fantastic phone. The cons, really, are not so much cons as tradeoffs. The phone is light because it's plastic - you're gonna want a good case for insurance. Battery life when all the bells and gizmos are turned on is mediocre. And maybe the speaker phone quality is only ok. Physically, those are only things wrong with it. Also, AT&T, like pretty much all mobile companies, is evil, but maybe more evil than most. Just stay low and get the right plan. Really, the biggest gripe I have with this phone is that it makes me feel like an idiot sometimes - and I'm not the dimmest bulb in the package. It has soooo many features and you will never use them all. You'll never use more than three or four of the included Samsung or AT&T apps. The coolest features won't work the way you think they should work unless you dive into the sub-sub-submenus and look for tutorials online. The phone will randomly do things you didn't ask it to - but it's your fault, because you did a swipe when you should have flicked. She's a wonderful woman, the S4, but you'll never truly understand her. If it sounds like I'm coming down hard on the S4, I'm not - far from it. I love that it has features I've only begun to discover (I've had it just over a month). I gave it 5 stars because I really don't care that I don't know everything about this phone - the mere fact that it CAN do all those things is amazing. Yes, she's amazing, that S4.

samsung,"A word of advice and my story: Please read.. I'm not just another one of those angry 1-star idiots that can't type and mad that I didn't get their product on time, I rarely write reviews but these scum bait bastards need to be addressed. Heed my warning and read my story. This phone was shown as a ""new"" product, as I was looking for a Sealed in box Galaxy S5 within a relatively cheap but fair price I thought I found a deal. I didn't, but ho boy was I properly deceived. When the phone came in it was in an almost official looking Samsung Galaxy S5 casing, and it was sealed. I popped it open and everything did look official and new, except for 1 thing: their was no manual and warranty. I found it odd but I figured in this day and age where companies are trying to reduce their environmental impact they got rid of them and opted for an online thing like most others do. the phone was scrubbed clean and had the samsung stickers on it, making it look like it was never touched. the charge cord and headphones were all in their bags everything looked real, it really fooled me. So I started up the phone after removing all the stickers and everything was working fine while it was going through the startup process, but then about 15 minutes in I saw a short screen flicker, I thought nothing of it but it was a sign of things to come. while going through the process of upgrading the apps, the android OS, and the transferring of my files to this phone this phone was getting hot, real hot, like cook eggs on it hot. again I brushed it off thinking and then reading about these model of phones heating up with a certain android version so I left it be until the upgrades were done. Few hours after the upgrades were complete were nice, the phone was operating as it should and felt fine, except I kept noticing some weird graphical glitches with screen swiping in the menus but I figured the android OS bugged up (early stages of denial at this point). also when I looked close, I noticed screen burn. now if you don't know what screen burn is it's basically the effect of what happens when a device is left on for hours, even days on end and whatever is shown on the screen in burned into the screen. but why would a ""new"" phone have screen burn? Fast forward 2 days later, small graphical hickups were still there but nothing was happening but I noticed something odd when I click on the phone. the ripple effect when you look at your lock screen was causing the graphical hickups for some reason so I went into the settings to change the effect. now I don't know why this certain small change in a setting cause these chain of events to unfold but I'm glad it did. I clicked off the phone to see the new lock screen effect and the phone just decided to go A-wall, the graphical glitches were worse and the screen flickering came back but it was every few minutes, the phones screen started to corrupt like crazy to the point where it was a garbled mess and not even an OS reformat was fixing it, it was a hardware issue. I went home and started examining the box and everything it came in, it was lucky that I still had my old box from my Galaxy S4 otherwise I wouldn't have been able to compare. first off the warning sticker that seals the box was different, a small detail but I noticed it. the box felt different then my S4 box different quality of cardboard was used. then I looked at the accessories. Now the reason I didn't check the headphones right away is because I used my own set and had my S4 headphones still in the bag in the other box. I compared the sound quality to the S4 headphones and....it was bad. the S4 headphones produced a wonderful sound quality while these S5's were shoddy and had horrible sound quality, the rubber coating on the cord felt different and the SAMSUNG logo on the side of the headphones was printed on, not glossed on like the S4 logo was. the charge cable I couldn't tell on but I checked the charge plug and noticed the same cheap printing the headphones had. A defective phone, counterfeit accessories, and no manual or warranty. I was scammed big time. Before I sent the phone back I wanted to see what happened to this phone exactly so I looked into it, turns out display kiosk phones (explains the screen burn) in other countries get ""refurbished"" by cheap manufacturers not affiliated with Samsung and sold as new phones for a quick sale. it's a common but very high level scam and someone that doesn't have an eye for detail will get fooled easily. I slammed all the crap back into the box and sent a return order in, took about 3 weeks but I got my money back. thank god for Amazon's return policy. Now my warning, if you're gonna buy a phone online do it via official sources. places like Amazon and Ebay are have too many unknown factors attached to them with their sellers. I was lied to by a seller called ""Real Deal Distributors"", where's the irony in that?! but if you still want to buy from here some tips. 1) Take a minute to examine your new phone, your eye for detail for any little thing will be key to seeing if it was a scam. 2) Check for a warranty and manual, Samsung later emailed me saying they would always send these with their official products. 3) If your phone starts displaying any weird symptoms like I've stated, stop using it right away. 4) Check your seller and site policy, again a key if you want your money back from a scam. 5) ...Just go to Gamestop if you want a cheap but REAL refurbished phone. they both have their own refurbishments and official samsung certified refurbishments, all done in person and with a great return policy. As for me? well I still have my Galaxy S4, cracked screen and all and Waiting for a Galaxy S7 from Gamestop. my stuff was fine I never transferred anything but apps onto that phone. something in the back of my head was telling me something was off I should've listened.

samsung,"Amazing Phone But........ * Skip to bottom summary if you do not have time to read this* Let me start off by saying I am in love with this phone. I have owned it for 3 months now and can't seem to put it down. It is big enough where I do not have to squint to read emails such as on the iphone and small enough where I can text and type one-handed (I have bigger hands). The features that come packed with this phone are all very useful and great. There are honestly more features than anyone would need to use, but more is always better. It is very fast and doesn't seem to skip a beat with all my programs running in the background, as well as astounding battery life that lets me go without a charge for a minimum of 2 days. I have not had the mentioned reception issues so it may just be a bad batch of phones or the service in my area is very good. * Now, I bet you're wondering why I am only giving this product 2 stars when I have just talked so highly of this product. The poor rating is for amazon customer service and their bloatware. I had initially purchased the phone and chosen an address for it to be shipped to. An hour after purchasing I recognized a different address was designated for shipping. I contacted amazon an hour after the purchase (3 days before it shipped) and told them the correct address for shipping. I was told the problem was addressed but behold, my product was shipped to the other address and I did not receive my product in time or at the correct location, not to mention the product came a day late. * Once I received my phone I was willing to let the shipping mistake slide until I started looking through the programs and realized I could not delete any of the apps that amazon preloaded onto the device. Granted, they are not very high in memory usage but when I spend 200$ of my hard earned money on a good product I would like to have the option of choosing which apps I need and don't need. To put it in perspective it is like buying a car and not having the option of choosing which features you want and don't want. The only thing you can do is disable the apps so they dont run in the background, but they still take up memory that should be free. The phone does come with other preloaded apps (samsung & google) that cannot be removed but they are at least desirable and used every day. I actually considered returning this phone due to the unnecessary bloatware and inability of removal, but decided that the product is too good to let a couple apps ruin its integrity. A company should not jam their products down a customer's throat and expect positive feedback. Quite actually, it deters me from using your apps on any of my devices. SUMMARY: Phone is a great product, much better than the Iphone 4s I switched from. Amazon shipping disappointed me and sent phone to wrong address. Amazon pre-loads their permanent bloatware apps onto the phone (cannot be removed). My recommendation is to purchase this phone from your cellular carrier as it will come preloaded with less bloatware apps.",2014-04-02,negative,2,en,amazing phone skip bottom summary time read let start saying love phone owned months cant seem put big enough squint read emails iphone small enough text type onehanded bigger hands features come packed phone useful great honestly features anyone would need use always better fast doesnt seem skip beat programs running background well astounding battery life lets go without charge minimum days mentioned reception issues may bad batch phones service area good bet youre wondering giving product stars talked highly product poor rating amazon customer service bloatware initially purchased phone chosen address shipped hour purchasing recognized different address designated shipping contacted amazon hour purchase days shipped told correct address shipping told problem addressed behold product shipped address receive product time correct location mention product came day late received phone willing let shipping mistake slide started looking programs realized could delete apps amazon preloaded onto device granted high memory usage spend hard earned money good product would like option choosing apps need dont need put perspective like buying car option choosing features want dont want thing disable apps dont run background still take memory free phone come preloaded apps samsung google cannot removed least desirable used every day actually considered returning phone due unnecessary bloatware inability removal decided product good let couple apps ruin integrity company jam products customers throat expect positive feedback quite actually deters using apps devices summary phone great product much better iphone switched amazon shipping disappointed sent phone wrong address amazon preloads permanent bloatware apps onto phone cannot removed recommendation purchase phone cellular carrier come preloaded less bloatware apps,0,2

samsung,"New Fan of Samsung because of the Note 3. This review is for the Note 3 in general, but also as a recommendation for LaptopAngels if that happens to be the seller somebody might be looking at. I gave LaptopAngels a 5-star review for sales and shipping, as well as for handling a return with courteous professionalism. The phone: The phone, the phone, the phone. I take back every bad thing I've ever said about Samsung. The 2-year-old Note 3 stacks right up there with every 2015 phone I've had my hands on. My daily driver is a Droid Turbo, and this Note 3 is every bit as much fun to ""drive"" as my Turbo is. I should qualify by saying that the Note 3 we eventually bought is still running Kitkat 4.4.2 (So I can't speak for this phone with Lollipop 5.x installed) and we plan to keep it on Kitkat... one BIG reason we were in the market for an older phone was an increasingly *severe* dislike for Lollipop. Basically, this phone replaces a new LG G4 with 5.1 (which replaced a G3 with 5.0) and the new owner could not be any happier. She had a Galaxy Note II before, and it croaked, which was the only reason she needed another phone. It was my mistake to steer her toward LG; should've considered the Note 3 in the first place.

samsung,"This phone is awesome.. I like it ten times better than the Iphone. No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..) I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good). Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes. Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome. I love that It has office in the phone. This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in. I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-) & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos. And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash. My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card. For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information. Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones. That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.) If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone. If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice. Just remember to get the right SD card. Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right. Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone. Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones. That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917. I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-) Update May 1st, 2013: One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now. I have not lost any calls, had any crashes, or lost any data. Oh and I did replace her Iphone. She loves her Samsung Focus.

samsung,"One of the phones in the photo has such a damaged LCD screen that it won't turn on. The other has a cracked screen.. The seemingly undamaged Galaxy S6 on the left is former; the iPhone 4S on the right is the latter. After having the S6 for 7 months, when the manufacturer's warranty was still active, the phone's screen started turning colors when plugged into my computer, and, over the course of a couple of hours, stopped working. (I had struggled to turn it on once before but thought it was a battery problem, which didn't seem to be the case when I got it on and there was still lots of battery life.) ""Have you ever dealt with Samsung?"" someone asked as I mentioned that I'd have to send in my phone for repairs. I had kept the phone in a $50 waterproof case and been careful with it, since I had previously endured the embarrassment of a cracked iPhone screen for over a year. Yet, after I sent it to in, Samsung claimed the phone wouldn't turn on due to damage to the LCD ""beneath the screen""; i.e., even though the screen looked immaculate, it was broken, and they determined it was my fault. They tried to charge me more than $160 to replace the LCD screen, after which they said they couldn't be sure I wouldn't have more charges after they were able to turn on the phone. Contrast this experience with the time I actually *did* drop my iPhone 4S and horribly cracked the screen; yet, it still worked. After covering it with a screen protector, it worked perfectly for more than a year when I bought the S6. I decided to start using my 4S until I bought an iPhone 5S off of Craigslist. (Be careful with Craigslist purchases; make sure the seller will meet you in a phone store where they can check that it wasn't stolen.) My 5S works great.

So back to the Alias 2 the phone is easy to figure out but does not work in all the ways it is said to work. Specifically I can not get this phone to pair with my blue tooth in my new car. I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon.

Here are my observations so far: â?Even when buying new batteries for my Note 4, the battery life just was getting suckier and suckier. The Note 8 easily lasts all day with regular use. Letâs hope it stays that way because you canât remove the Note 8âs batteries. â?Love that they still included an SD card slot in this phone. â?S-pen is better than ever, pressure sensitive, and can use it in a lot more placesâ? But how often do I use it? Seldom to never. â?The C-type USB makes the Note 8 charge super fast. â?The drawback is that it does not charge really fast when plugged into regular USB-2 ports, I get a warning on my phone telling me to plug in to a different spot. â?The screen size is big and beautiful, essentially going edge to edge. This phone does not add a lot of width over and above the older Note series, but is much taller. â?Sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I would like â?Bixby is a slow learner. Either you are going to need to invest some time with this to get it to work right or you will be annoyed that it wastes a whole button just for its operation. â?Love the apps edge menus.

samsung,"Very good phone for the money. It's a very good Smartphone for the Money. Android 8.0. Came with lots of bloatware from AT&T which all is not usable abroad the US. Some of the bloatware does not allow to be uninstalled. Otherwise buy with confidence, it's a good fone. SAMOLED Display, it is Unlocked so you can put in any SIM Card, the Display is easy to read at 70% brightness in brigth sun ligth outside. Battery Lasting is not so great as with an J2 Prime I have so this lasts for about 2 days only with WiFi allways on while my J2 Prime lasts between 3 and 5 days with Wifi off. Android 8.0 Oreo is a bit better than Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow but not that much difference in daily life. This phone constantly is searching for something while I have disabled anything I could disable so dont know what else to disable to make the battery last longer. It's super responsive and does all what a Smartphone is supposed to do. Battery is replaceble and 2600 mAh I believe. Fotos are good enough but as with the J2 Prime lack of digital stabilizer so they are easy to blurr out. Otherwise for ordinary life a decent camera. Front selfie Flash not existant but it has back Flash. For the selfies it brightens up lots the Screen which is replacing the Flash I guess which works well. Good Quality Samsung phone as allways expected from Samsung. Only negative is the a bit short life of the battery but this Screen is HD and SAMOLED as they Claim so it may use a bit more of energy. Despite that, if switched off all antennas, one may get well 3 days of use of one battery Charge. Small form factor phone. I recommend this model and brand.

samsung,"Sleek phone with some cool features. I purchased this phone for the camera, and as a guy who isn't a heavy user, I wasn't too terribly concerned about hardcore performance or battery life. I have been blown away by this device. I use it way more than I ever thought I would. Pros: great camera, quick response and processing, call quality is good, simple and easy to use the android OS; great battery life (rarely do I go beneath 40%), and very customizable. The curved screen definitely intrigued me from the start, and did play a role in my decision to purchase. It puts all your quick access apps in one spot and has a notification feature to check texts and emails super discretely while the screen is dark. Cons: It's pretty big, which would be an issue for an average user, but I have big hands, so it's not a big deal. Also a minor complaint is the really short charge cord. It's only like 2.5 feet. Not a huge deal, but worth noting. I have no complaints about the operating system at all.

samsung,"Overall a very good phone.. Phone came unlocked and ready to use. I like windows as i find asy to use. This has windows 7.5. It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures. It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked.

samsung,"Great phone with disappointing stylus. I loved my old Samsung Note 4 until the screen broke and would have cost more to fix than the phone was worth. The Note 8 is definitely a huge improvement on many fronts -- a more vivid screen, a zippier processor, more than ample memory, above-average battery life, wireless charging, and superb security features. The Note 8 can be unlocked by fingerprint sensor, iris detection, face detection, voice recognition, passcode or pattern, authorized GPS location(s), and detection of registered Bluetooth devices nearby; these security measures are used concurrently, so there is rarely any hesitation in unlocking the phone. So why only three stars? First, I hate the curved ""infinity"" screen -- it's not well-protected by any case I have found and it scratches far too easily. Second, the S-Pen stylus is far too sensitive, making it extremely difficult to write legibly or make accurate drawings, for example; unfortunately, the stylus sensitivity is NOT adjustable, which is a huge miss, in my opinion. Hell, the stylus is the reason most users buy the Note 8 instead of the Galaxy S8, so to not offer a customizable experience is absolutely baffling! Lastly, Bluetooth performance is pretty weak for a flagship phone like this. I regularly have connection problems on a multitude of devices, can't stray more than a dozen feet away, and suffer annoying drop-outs on wireless earbuds -- all problems that my wife doesn't have with her much older iPhone. Come on, Samsung, get your sh*t together!

samsung,"Samsung made a fabulous phone in the S4. This review is for the black mist 16GB Galaxy S4 for Sprint. I recently switched to this phone after having the Galaxy Note 2. I love both phones and the Note had that glorious screen and built in S-Pen. But, for me, as a phone, the Note is just a bit too big for my personal taste and I found the call volume to be weak even with sound boost. So I moved to the S4, thinking it would give me most of the benefits of the Note in a more compact package. After a couple of weeks using this I can tell you it is a fantastic phone. I am running the latest version of KitKat and this phone is smooth as silk with little to no lag. The screen is gorgeous, the size is perfect, and the call quality is outstanding. This is my fourth Samsung phone and I understand some the critics complaining about TouchWiz, battery life, etc. Here's a couple of simple things I did : I downloaded Nova Launcher and run it as my main launcher. Is very smooth and fast. Secondly, the stock battery, quite frankly, is lousy. I purchased two after market batteries and a charger from Amazon then purchased an extended 5200 mah battery as well. I am currently using one of the standard size batteries and still at 20% life after almost eleven hours. That is excellent. Screen brightness maxed, bluetooth on, etc. Moderate to heavy usage. So, while the stock battery isn't that good, the phone itself doesn't just suck the juice. A better battery makes a world of difference. This is the best phone I've had in Sprint.

samsung,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Samsung Galaxy Note 10 (HR).. Pros:__________ Â· Compact design, almost bezeless display, feels extremely solid, and the design is purely top notch. Nothing else out there as of 2019. Â· The AMOLED display looks fantastic. I found it a joy when watching or reading anything from this screen. Â· I found the fingerprint reader to be very sensitive and quick. Â· The Aura Glow is something I honestly thought I would hate. But this rainbow effect is a beautiful look because you donât see a rainbow but, depending on the angle of the phone, you only see one color. Look from a different angle I get a different color. Very creative and something new in a world of black and white phones. Â· The video editor is super easy to trim and add music to your clips. I did see that it does work with Adobe Premiere Rush, so thatâs a big smile for all your move makers on the go. I will also say, using the pen is a lifesaver when youâre trying to trim seconds of a clip on a smartphone. Â· For a phone like this, battery life is very good. From 0-100% it only took an hour, and as an average phone user, a full day charge, with the 25-watt charging they provided, will bring my phone around 20% battery life left. Samsung has a 45 W charger than can cut the time in half of the charging, but you need to pay extra for that one. Still impressive. Â· The S Pen is shorter and thinner than it looks in person. Â· The Pen does an excellent job of converting my weak handwriting into a text. All you have to do is write your note, tap the text area, and press an onscreen âConvertâ?button. For English grammar, it worked flawlessly for me. I see the use of this feature if you need to take a quick note asap. Â· You can sync the Note 10 to your windows desktop (Dex mode). I havenât tested this feature out, as youâll need a USB-C to USB-C, but I do love that you have a mini laptop hard drive in your pocket. Just connect it to a computer and the phone will mirror its screen on to your monitor. I can see this super useful if you need to do presentations at work. Just put the PowerPoint file in your phone and connect it to your computer at work. Â· Another cool feature in the video making world for this phone is the âzoom-in micâ?feature. If you donât have an extension microphone, the phone will use the mics that it has, but not at the same time. When recording, it will the mics on the front of the phone to record your voice, making it clearer. And if you zoom in the mic sensitivity will increase, like having a boom mic. I didnât test this fully as youâll need to spend some time comparing this feature, but from basic video playback, the mics are spot on. Samsung is putting up its gain for anyone who wants to film. Â· Taking photos or videos in very difficult places, the S pen will be your best friend. You can begin filming, or taking, shots, by just clicking on the S pen. Itâs a small feature, but I believe is one of the most useful to have. Â· The stabilization is excellent. I was just walking while filming, and it looks like the phone was on a wire. This is the best stabilization Iâve seen on a phone so far. Well done Samsung. Â· You have revers charging with this phone, which will, of course, kill your battery. But still, cool to have. Â· The AR Doodle feature is really cute if your taking photos with friends. I took a picture of just random people and this feature allows me to draw anywhere on the pic without destroying it. Using the pen, making hats and mustaches can make even boring pictures funny. Â· The Live Focus mode main function is to let you blur out the background. I did like this a lot because you can just block anyone in the background that doesnât fit your âperfectâ?picture. It does work well if your object is focused before taking your shot. Â· The cameras areâ¦wellâ¦there just great. Sharp, colorful, ultra-wide provides the same color profile/quality as close up zoom. The details that these cameras can provide is beyond words. I have nothing to say on the overall outcome a smartphone camera like this. Itâs the top of the class until Googleâs Pixel comes into play. Â· The sound is also great. It doesnât come to any specific location, but rather throughout the phone. Samsung built the volume deep in the phone so it can go everywhere, are you will never cover it with your hands. Loud and crisp (no base though). Â· Playing games like Altoâs Odyssey had no issues other than getting noticeably warm after 40 minutes, which makes sense for that power. Also thanks to the support of UFS 3.0 specification, youâre going to get faster loading times (This was hard to test how much of an impact it has on the phones day-to-day activities, but all I can say is that I had little to none loading time). Cons and Oks:__________ Â· Itâs the end. No more headphone jack. Bringing so much joy and now Samsungâs closest ally has let it go. Â· The night mode is good, but itâs still nowhere compared to phones like Google. Samsung has yet to master the night mode shots as their system is to up the ISO and slow the shutter speed. They did up there game, but itâs still not enough to get great night shots. Iâm overall getting a busy shot and using the telephoto and ultra-wide lenses are both useless at night. Â· No microSD card slot on the Note 10. Â· The ultra-wide sometimes creates a fisheye effect. You will see this effect more if there are some bright/mixed colors at the end of your pictures (like a tree or a building with windows). I did notice that I got a slight bend at the way end of my pictures, which makes the image look weird. The solution I found was just to crop the image. I hope software updates will fix this. Â· With a group of people walking in the background, there were times that the phone had a hard time trying to get focused on the person I was taking. This happens when trying to use the regular and telephoto lenses. Â· The telephoto lenses tend to over sharpen my images. Taking a close pic of a rose I saw this issue come up. Now for a regular person, this is no issue at all, but for a photographers eye, youâll see this. Â· Be warned, get a case. An all-glass design makes writing with the pen a slippery task. I felt more concern holding the phone than what I was writing, so I knew this a must-have case. Â· You can only write short notes with the pen. I notice that you canât even write a full sentence on a single line if you wanted the phone to convert your writing into a text. Â· 45-watt charger cost extra. Â· The front-facing camera isâ¦well, itâs a front-facing camera. Nowhere near as good as the back, but good enough for having meetings. Â· Samsungâs keyboard is horrible to use. If you get this download Gboard, itâs the best in smartphone keyboards. Â· The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is fast, but even the tiniest dirt on your finger, it makes the process a little slower. Nothing really impressive on this if your hands are sweaty or dirty. Â· I hate the fact that you have to go to your notifications to shut down the phone. Holding the power button activated Bixby, you can change this if you want. To be honest, Bixby isnât the best around, so Iâll always change it. Â· The S pen Air Actions are a neat little tool to use, but I saw more as an accessory than a tool. I didnât feel the need to use this feature, but it does work. It also does take some practice to get the hang of it but itâs irrelevant for the day to day use. Â· The battery drains at a pretty consistent rate. The beauty of the device is the screen, but itâs the most that kills the battery. Â· Every single space on this phone is a fingerprint magnet. Â· This phone does have a little more weight than your average smartphone. Bottom Line:__________ Samsung is putting the stops in making this a phone for filming. With an almost bezel-less display, an excellent video editing program, and a great battery life, the theory is supported. I admire the premium layout of this phone as the S-pen is very fun to use (but not yet a priority in daily use), the screen is just beautiful, and the system as a whole is excellent. There are some issues with the cameras on this phone, like the ânight modeâ?inaccurate pictures, and I also wish they moved the front-facing camera to the side like before (even though the little black camera is small, itâs still noticeable.). But the honest truth is that I really have nothing super negative about it. Some small issues are there, but I know software updates will fix these problems, or at least I hope they can. Overall: A phone enjoyed for everyone, but built for those who want to film. Hope I was a help to you.

samsung,"Speedy workhorse. Upgraded only a couple months ago from the slow albeit still working Galaxy S2 to the contemporary Note 3. I got a nice used one. Wow, what a huge difference. The Note 3 has blistering speed, sharp screen, and loud and clear phone. Plus, I'm totally happy with Android and do not feel that I need iOS. Other factors that have been absolutely solid that play into my overall satisfaction include long battery life, great camera, quality build, and the fact that there has not been a single operational glitch or app crash. I don't have any complaints, just a happy customer. ---- 8/12/17 Two years and 3 months into ownership, I'm still very pleased with the Note 3. It is totally performing like day one except for the battery lasting probably 20 to 25% less. Otherwise not a single issue in any way. My work phone is iPhone 6S, so I really feel like I'm getting the best of both worlds. Will probably upgrade next year. I am really not certain to stay with Android or go to iOS, they are both great. One thing for certain, I will get a smaller form factor for ease of carry. I no longer use the phone camera and videos as much as I used to, got a Sony action cam for that with amazing optical stabilization, sound, and 100x faster focus.

samsung,To good to ignore. A definite must buy. All in 1 purchase.. Best phone purchase I've ever made. I've been using LG phones previous to this purchase. I had basic LG smart phone fairly current. The last Samsung Galaxy Note I had was in like 2012. I've obviously missed a lot of extraordinary innovation from Samsung. I researched & compared this Note 8 & a LG V40 or LG G7 QThin (both refurbished & unlocked). Ultimately my choice was obvious because I wanted & needed everything this Samsung Galaxy Note 8 was offering. It even had more features to offer than I initially knew about. I am eager now to upgrade to the Note 9 or better. I appreciate the refurbished quality being like new in performance as well as ascetics. The price difference between this refurbished Note 8 & a new Note 8 is the real deciding factor. You can't not give it a try. With Amazons A-Z guarentee & the backing they offer for refurbished devices.. I just can't express how impressed I am with my Refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 8. I dont use the facial recognition frequently but I've explored the quality of it. Depending on the light when you set your face for the recognition it's actually pretty accurate & secure. Screen quality is #1 in my opinion. Not to mention all the customization options you have. Battery life is of a good quality but we all know regardless of the phones internal battery life you can always increase it with additional battery packs but my phone is active 24/7 & the battery lasts longer than I do. I'm satisfied to say the least & I plan to purchase Samsung Electronics again.,2019-03-24,positive,5,en,good ignore definite must buy purchase best phone purchase ive ever made ive using lg phones previous purchase basic lg smart phone fairly current last samsung galaxy note like ive obviously missed lot extraordinary innovation samsung researched compared note lg v lg g qthin refurbished unlocked ultimately choice obvious wanted needed everything samsung galaxy note offering even features offer initially knew eager upgrade note better appreciate refurbished quality like new performance well ascetics price difference refurbished note new note real deciding factor cant give try amazons az guarentee backing offer refurbished devices cant express impressed refurbished samsung galaxy note dont use facial recognition frequently ive explored quality depending light set face recognition actually pretty accurate secure screen quality opinion mention customization options battery life good quality know regardless phones internal battery life always increase additional battery packs phone active battery lasts longer im satisfied say least plan purchase samsung electronics,2,2

samsung,"The phone works, but was disappointing.. I rarely give bad reviews; however, I have been very disappointed with both this phone, and the associated pay-as-you-go service from AT&T. The reception (sound quality) is very poor. This is the case even in areas with strong tower signals. This is my only real complaint about the phone itself, but as my entire reason for having the phone is communication, it's a big deal. The one plus worth mentioning is that the battery-life on the phone lasts for a week easy if not used. As for the service, here are a few things that I was not aware of prior to purchasing this phone, and activating the pay-as-you-go service: The advertised 10 cents per minute is before various taxes are applied, so do not expect 100 minutes for $10. In addition, minutes are always rounded up, so if you will be making many short calls with this phone, know that this adds up. Also, be sure to tell people not to text the number, as you are charged 25 cents per text. Be aware that when you do buy minutes for the phone, they expire in 30 days (if spending less than $25), 90 days (if spending between $25 and $99), or 1 year (if spending $100 or more). To summarize, with this phone, you get what you pay for. It's cheap, and due to poor reception, conversations are difficult. They also end up costing more than may be apparent. The minutes have an expiration date making this phone's use as an emergency phone a bit less effective. That being said, you do get a functioning phone for $15, and for another $10, you can make and receive a few calls.",2014-09-07,negative,2,en,phone works disappointing rarely give bad reviews however disappointed phone associated payasyougo service att reception sound quality poor case even areas strong tower signals real complaint phone entire reason phone communication big deal one plus worth mentioning batterylife phone lasts week easy used service things aware prior purchasing phone activating payasyougo service advertised cents per minute various taxes applied expect minutes addition minutes always rounded making many short calls phone know adds also sure tell people text number charged cents per text aware buy minutes phone expire days spending less days spending year spending summarize phone get pay cheap due poor reception conversations difficult also end costing may apparent minutes expiration date making phones use emergency phone bit less effective said get functioning phone another make receive calls,0,0

samsung,"Pixel density and screen are awful.. As a Note user since NOTE 2, with 2 or 3 Galaxy Note's in use at every moment (I use 3 lines, all with Notes, always) here are my thoughts: 1) Buying experience and seller 10/10. (I bought a U.S. unlocked note 10+). 2) Experience UI 1.5 is a serious downgrade from UI 1.0. 3) I replaced a Note 8 with the Note 10+ while I am using 2 Note 9's. The pixel density and color reproduction going from 500+ pixels to 400+ is so obvious, the Note 8 was light years ahead in color. No comparison to the 9. It's night and day. Even my Note 4 of yesteryear had better colors. All in FHD+ BTW. For $1,100 I expected better Samsung. Sad to say, if I did not need the features such as Write On PDF and Hancom Office Editor, and hated the return process to boot, I would have returned the Note 10+ for another Note 9. 4) And Samsung, why do you include a 15 watt charger, with extremely fast charging capabilities but you include a 2 feet long cable for $1,100? Are you guys serious? 2 feet are useless!!!! Keep it up and soon you will only be selling series J and series A. Sad to say!!!! Color reproduction and pixelation is simply HORRIBLE!!!

I would get ""fly out"" menus on almost every app whether it was phone, photos, text, e-mail, and others. I did a factory reset to see if that would help, but if anything it got worse. It made the phone almost useless. I confirmed that it had a warranty for 1 year from date of purchase and contacted Samsung customer service. They told me I needed to send the receipt along with the IMEI # and the phone # listed in the subject line and I would be contacted within 48 hours. I called them back 3 days later and was told it was best to wait until they received proof of purchase. After some discussion I finally convinced him that it doesn't take days for an email to arrive. Then he told me the warranty expired in 2015 and any warranty that I may have seen on Amazon was an Amazon warranty not Samsung. After more discussion he finally told me to text the receipt to a phone #. I called them back 3 days later and was told the IMEI # wasn't on the receipt and they couldn't do anything until Amazon provided me one with the # on it. I contacted Amazon through a live chat and explained what I needed. His first comment was ""can you return this to Amazon""? That was a total surprise that they would take it back after using it for several months. I certainly never expected that, but greatly appriecate not having to deal with Samsung and getting the run around from them. It should be delivered to them tomorrow and they indicated that I would recieve an 80% refund. That seems very fair after using the phone for several months and considering they didn't have to do anything.

samsung,"Read review. The phone we bought from this vendor howls loudly during incoming calls. Yes, howls.....kinda screechy and buzz-y.

I can talk about the screen, the stylus (Infinite Paint is a must download,) or the camera; which literally amazes me with its superiority over iPhone. None of that matters. The biggest strength of the Note 8 isn't it's RAM, it's the battery. With all that power comes a balanced performance between usage and creation, and it comes in the form of the Note 8's 3300mAh size battery.

Here are some things I really really like about the Samsung smart phones that seem to be lacking on other phones *coughMotorolacough*. 1. It has a built in voice-recorder. 2. You can use many features without forking over your location, you email account and password, etc. I refuse to put my email account on my phone, and I don't let it use 'my location' ever. 3. You can turn the data on and off very easily. 4. It has a memo app, stock. It has the additional press-keys at the very bottom of the phone, which for some reason I like better than no buttons at all. It's like having the Force Quit option on the Apples. All this said, the phone is a great looking phone, big but not heavy. I paired it with a Zizo phone case, which fit perfectly and looks sharp.

samsung,Excellent Phone. The big brother and improved version of Samsung focus. It is excellent and user friendly with Windows Phone 7.5 . It will probably suppourt windows Phone 8 if it becomes Available to update for current Windows mobiles since it is the latest generation of Windows Phones.Though it has a small bug of frreze up the improved firmware is now available and has no problem since I updated it with new firmware. Pros: 1. Better pixel density than focus. 2. Faster 1.4 Ghz processor. 3. Is capable of 4G. 5. Is latest generation of Windows phone. 6. Front facing camera for skype or video chat or video call 7. Excellent 5 MP camera. Cons: 1. Sometimes freeze up.(though updating firmware solves it muchly) but not completely. 2. Smaller screen than samsung focus(3.7 vs 4 inches) So This is an excellent phone for the price.Just go for it. For its specs the phone should be sold for a price range of $250+. Update :12 August 2012 After using phone for like 4 months I have following things to say: 1. I havent faced a single phone freeze after the recent tango update(there is way to trick phone to update even though AT&T doesnt push it) 2. The app center is growing rapidly(In last few months as I myself have seen). There are a lots of apps tailored for your need. 3. Games works great on this device no freezing and lagging. 4.

samsung,There's a simple trick to this. My phone is working great.. I should've heeded the reviews that i read. This phone is not unlocked at all. Updated: So the trick to getting this device to work is you have to call your network provider and tell them you're switching your phone but keeping the same sim card.

samsung,"So much right, Great battery, Small missteps. When I heard the Note 5 had not only a non-removable battery, but a smaller capacity compared to previous Note's, I was hesitant; especially after the S6 left a sour taste in my mouth in terms of its lasting power. But I have to say, in my short time with this device, it has impressed me. The very first day I was able to get 6 hours of Screen on Time after messing around with the phone relentlessly, installing apps, streaming music a bit, browsing the web, disabling apps, playing a few games (for maybe 40 minutes), you name it. Obviously this scenario is a bit harder on it than your normal day to day use as excessive downloading and installing of apps is fairly intensive, not to mention just playing with the new device constantly. So the first day, after charging it to 100%, it was off the charger a total of a bit over 10 hours at that point with about 10% left - but with screen on time at over 6 hours mixed with standby and all the other intensive stuff I was doing, that is a great figure which greatly eclipses what my S6 could do. Day to day it is FAR better than that though. It is clear the larger 3,000 mAh battery is not just a concession to power the larger screen and having battery life end up just matching the S6 (with its smaller ~2500 mAh battery). As it stands today, my GSam Battery Monitor app shows I get, on average, 17 hours battery life with just shy of 6 hours screen on time per complete charge. I've yet to actually run out of battery, most times having 20% or more by plug in time. So these estimates are pretty true to life, though pure standby time can see this phone last a few days easily - Samsung really upped its game on standby time on this over the S6. I never turn wifi and bluetooth off, and I have a Moto 360 connected all the time as well. You might even get slightly better life if these things don't apply to you and you keep them turned off most of the time. This phone looks as though it will not struggle to get you through a day, even under fairly heavy usage. The ""cell standby"" drain from the S6 appears to have lessened, even if not completely fixed, but at least to the point where it is no longer the biggest battery drainer (before, it had even managed to top the charts when I had 3 hours of screen on time on the S6!). Everything about the design is great, it is a nice weight without feeling too light, the rounded corners and slightly thinner width helps with one-handleability, and it is a nice step up from the all plastic build of my Note 3. It is handsome and it feels rather premium. The glass on the back does make the device feel a little bit more fragile, like you have to be more mindful and baby it some. I'd say you largely will have to be more mindful, to some degree, than you would with the previous all-plastic models. However there were concerns the all glass construction would make it far too slippery, but I don't find it too problematic. You can wrap your fingers around it pretty easily in one hand, but one handed operation where your fingers lay on the back to do most of the supporting doesn't feel too worrying either. If your hands are wet beyond a light sweat (in which case, why are you handling a smartphone lol), you'll notice the lack of grip you are probably more accustomed to on textured, plastic backed phones. But I haven't really had any issues to this point, for what that is worth. The device runs super fluid with nary a hitch to be found. Even though it has the same processor as the months old S6, I can't fault the device for not giving the processor the customary Note spec bump. It is plenty powerful and appears to be quite solid in terms of power efficiency - far more so than it appeared on the S6. I'd rather have this power/efficiency combo than a newer chip that would - more than likely - hit the battery harder. The 4 GB of RAM is nice to have, but it does seem like the overactive RAM manager still likes to kill apps, making apps require a restart rather than resume. Not always the case, but it seems to happen enough to make note of. Not a big deal to me, but it may be for others. I think this is also a battery saving measure to keep multiple apps from stacking up and unnecessarily taking CPU cycles or pinging the Internet constantly in the background. It's missing the removable battery and expandable storage, which is a knock against it - but not enough to knock a star off in my book. These are an expectation for the Note series by most, and obviously a reduction of features any way you look at it. How important they are to you depends on your usage. I have a 32 GB model after having a 32 GB Note 3 paired with a 32 GB micro SD card. I pared my glut of games back to a reasonable amount - still have a ton installed - and that's all it required for me. This was something I was doing on my Note 3, so it didn't feel like a concession when I switched to the Note 5. I also either stream music or use my iPod Touch for music, so I don't need storage for that. I don't store local video and I don't take a lot of pictures or videos, so space is fine for me. If you need more, 64 GB tops the capacity for this model and it seems pretty fair for most users. If you need more, then this is obviously going to struggle to contend for your affection since 128 GB is currently unavailable, and will be absurdly pricey when it does eventually come around. The S-Pen is still a great stylus. More responsive and far less friction on the screen than the one on my Note 3. It appears to work better for general navigation as well, requiring only a single tap (rather than a few sometimes required on my Note 3). The screen-off note writing feature is a nice one, not having to worry about the screen firing up and so on - this is a nice, immediate way to take a quick note. The features of the pop up S-Pen launcher are all familiar, excepting small tweaks to existing features like being able to take a long screen capture - say a several page webpage you'd have to scroll. The release mechanism takes a little getting used to - with the little depression it takes to get it to pop out - but once you get used to it, it works well. Any better/more secure than on the Note 3? Not to my experience, as I never had issues with the pen from the Note 3 getting accidentally pulled out, or conversely any issue getting it out of its holder. But this is a nice implementation, and adds to the slightly more refined Note experience. The base price of $700 is pretty high, but if you trade in an old phone and get the $200 credit, you're looking at a pretty fair price when matched against other phones. I am quite happy with this as an upgrade over my Note 3, and FAR happier than I was with the S6 which I had for the full 14 days before deciding to exchange it for this. If you take stock of everything you may just realize that, for you at least, the ire drawn by Internet power users is not quite that crippling or straight up device-ruining. I miss the two removed features, largely because I would rather have access to the battery to replace if the cells start going later on in the phone's life, but right now I'm quite happy with the package as it stands and have no qualms recommending it.",2015-08-25,positive,5,en,much right great battery small missteps heard note nonremovable battery smaller capacity compared previous notes hesitant especially left sour taste mouth terms lasting power say short time device impressed first day able get hours screen time messing around phone relentlessly installing apps streaming music bit browsing web disabling apps playing games maybe minutes name obviously scenario bit harder normal day day use excessive downloading installing apps fairly intensive mention playing new device constantly first day charging charger total bit hours point left screen time hours mixed standby intensive stuff great figure greatly eclipses could day day far better though clear larger mah battery concession power larger screen battery life end matching smaller mah battery stands today gsam battery monitor app shows get average hours battery life shy hours screen time per complete charge ive yet actually run battery times plug time estimates pretty true life though pure standby time see phone last days easily samsung really upped game standby time never turn wifi bluetooth moto connected time well might even get slightly better life things dont apply keep turned time phone looks though struggle get day even fairly heavy usage cell standby drain appears lessened even completely fixed least point longer biggest battery drainer even managed top charts hours screen time everything design great nice weight without feeling light rounded corners slightly thinner width helps onehandleability nice step plastic build note handsome feels rather premium glass back make device feel little bit fragile like mindful baby id say largely mindful degree would previous allplastic models however concerns glass construction would make far slippery dont find problematic wrap fingers around pretty easily one hand one handed operation fingers lay back supporting doesnt feel worrying either hands wet beyond light sweat case handling smartphone lol youll notice lack grip probably accustomed textured plastic backed phones havent really issues point worth device runs super fluid nary hitch found even though processor months old cant fault device giving processor customary note spec bump plenty powerful appears quite solid terms power efficiency far appeared id rather powerefficiency combo newer chip would likely hit battery harder gb ram nice seem like overactive ram manager still likes kill apps making apps require restart rather resume always case seems happen enough make note big deal may others think also battery saving measure keep multiple apps stacking unnecessarily taking cpu cycles pinging internet constantly background missing removable battery expandable storage knock enough knock star book expectation note series obviously reduction features way look important depends usage gb model gb note paired gb micro sd card pared glut games back reasonable amount still ton installed thats required something note didnt feel like concession switched note also either stream music use ipod touch music dont need storage dont store local video dont take lot pictures videos space fine need gb tops capacity model seems pretty fair users need obviously going struggle contend affection since gb currently unavailable absurdly pricey eventually come around spen still great stylus responsive far less friction screen one note appears work better general navigation well requiring single tap rather sometimes required note screenoff note writing feature nice one worry screen firing nice immediate way take quick note features pop spen launcher familiar excepting small tweaks existing features like able take long screen capture say several page webpage youd scroll release mechanism takes little getting used little depression takes get pop get used works well bettermore secure note experience never issues pen note getting accidentally pulled conversely issue getting holder nice implementation adds slightly refined note experience base price pretty high trade old phone get credit youre looking pretty fair price matched phones quite happy upgrade note far happier full days deciding exchange take stock everything may realize least ire drawn internet power users quite crippling straight deviceruining miss two removed features largely would rather access battery replace cells start going later phones life right im quite happy package stands qualms recommending,2,2

samsung,"Becomes Slow and Buggy, Loses Performance Quickly. This has been the worst phone I've ever owned. First, shortly after buying it, the screen stopped working and went black. I was lucky that I was able to exchange for another one (which was probably refurbished as well). Within less than a year of using the new phone, the phone has slowed to a crawl to where it takes 20 seconds to open the maps, or camera, or internet browser, or any other app. I've tried everything like keeping performance mode on, uninstalling all apps, safe mode, reset, etc. Still having issues. I don't think there is a virus or anything goofy on my phone. I recently started playing more with my work iPhone and will probably switch to iPhone. It will take some time to get used to it but it is a lot faster and doesn't seem to have all the software issues that Android has. I also don't like how Android doesn't give you the choice to cancel an update, after so many times of prolonging it, it will not give you a choice but will force you to install. Apps are also updating like twice a week which says a lot about the quality and reputability of the original publisher(s). What are they always changing twice a week? Who knows what these changes are and what they are doing to your phone and privacy, it is not fair that they don't always release notes regularly on what was changed.

samsung,"Should not have been ""certified"", in too rough of shape.. After having this phone for a while I honestly regret buying this used, even if it is ""certified refurbished"". It comes down to the phone that I got having issues that should NOT pass a certification test. Two problems, 1) there is horrible screen burn in on the phone. I have tried using apps to make it better and nothing is working. It is obvious that this used to be a display phone because it has the hideous default background permanently burned into the backlight of the screen. This makes part of the screen still usable, but there will always be a distortion of the image. You can do things to minimize it, but you shouldn't have to in the 1st place. 2) the homekey button came slightly peeled. This is a KNOWN issue with gold S7s, that is CAN happen, but the fact that it ALREADY WAS is ridiculous. Not sure if the fault should be on whoever certifies these, or who sells them, but these suck. Also, minor annoyance, the box came with a cheap POS charger that spit out such little charge it was barely worth it and no headphones (no that I would expect that with a refurb, but still writing it). The only reason I haven't returned it is because I simply can't.

samsung,"Phone not same as advertised!. The phone ordered was advertised and supposed to be an AT&T Galaxy Note 5. The phone received was an unlocked Verizon.

Nothing was said in the description about the phone being unlocked. It also will not pick up AT&T signal as well as previous Note 5.

samsung,"in LOVE with my new phone!!. Samsung Galaxy Note 10, by seller: AradSystemCR I was highly sceptical of the ""Renewed"" deal, but I need to save some money! I had never bought a phone sight unseen, certainly not in a degree of used and most defiantly not in this price range, but I am so glad I did! The Note 10, looks brand new!! I'm sure it is!! It came in the original box, covered with a Samsung screen protector, in the soft little bag. All of the factory accessories seem to be included: Samsung fast charger, usb-c cable, (Not usb-C/Samsung) headphone/earbuds and the key needed to remove/install the sim-card. The S-Pen was in it's compartment on the phone. The battery had a 50% charge. With previous Galaxy phones I seem to recall an instruction manual in the box? Perhaps they stopped doing that? Nevertheless the manual was simple to find on the Internet. There was a typed written note included, stating; that the phone had been tested on AT&T and/or T Mobile and that please address any issues or concerns to the seller: AradSystemCR. Activation: When I first started the Note 10, before inserting the sim-card, it had a Verizon Wireless, splash screen. I'm on Verizon, so I was hoping it would go easy - and it did!! After connecting to my WiFi network, I let the phone charge completely, while I played a little with it a little, then turned off. I moved the sim-card to this; new Note 10, and turned the phone back on. Just as it started I received a text from a friend, I made a before I could reply to the text I received a phone call. Now I am really happy!! Migrating Data & Apps: I had read a recent review on the phone recommending Samsung Smart Switch. WOW, this worked flawlessly!! I had one issue with data and apps installed on a MicroSD card, which, of course, this phone cannot use. So now I have a folder; _ExternalCard_ that I cannot delete because I do not want to risk loosing my health related data for the past two years. I manually dragged all of the photos & videos to the default location, via Windows file explorer. I deleted all of the music and re-synced the PC with my Note 10's music app. All and all, migration and activation took me an hour, which was so much better than anticipated!! I had to re-enter my gmail account and all app related passwords. Everything was in the exact location as my old Galaxy j7v, all of my paired devices were listed, but I had to connect them all once before using them. The Note 10, did not seem to have any additional apps - bloatwear installed. It had nothing from Verizon, AT&T or anyone else, and only the generic Samsung/Android apps. I did have to install an Android update and restart. I installed the Verizon app, from Google Play. My only Issues: I choose the free shipping, which took a week. I knew this going in, but perhaps I am just spoiled to Amazon Prime, next day shipping. lol Now I need to learn these awesome new features. The s-pen is Awesome! The Note 10 is so fast!! I strongly recommend the seller: AradSystemCR, my brother is searching his store now and I have 3 good friends whom will be before Christmas. Thank you AradSystemCR!!

samsung,"Surprisingly Durable. As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you. Pros: Durable Reliable good for texting Cons: A little slow sometimes It's slippery Not a smartphone but it's a cheap one The best secret feature is that if you scratch the back a certain way it makes a cool noise like scratching a record.",2010-06-03,positive,4,en,surprisingly durable teenager lot texting phone great full qwerty keyboard want number pad changing keys cool people go ooo ahh see flip ways megapixel camera good recording video photos small piece holding screen bottom unit corner seems flimsy pictures flimsy device problem fact walking home trail dropped without realizing next day looking walking trail noticed mud mortified people drive atvquads trail upon lifting phone saw run caked mud knew going work wet amazingly worked fine got home brushed paper towel good new problem change keyboard layout order get numbers makes hard type number type four nice reliable little phone interested standard phone texting calling great pros durable reliable good texting cons little slow sometimes slippery smartphone cheap one best secret feature scratch back certain way makes cool noise like scratching record,2,2

I also mentioned how video recording was terrible for whatever reasons and photo quality inferior in many cases to my wife's mi 10 ultra.

This phone has camera 2 API support, so it's support gcam stable version. Even stock camera app also good. But gcam was great, in gcam it beat the big brother Redmi note 8 pro. Especially in night mode was simply awesome. It supports upto 4k 30fps video. Selfie 13MP Camera also have a decent performance.Performance:- 3.5 out of 5The Snapdragon 665 has a decent performance in this phone. If you're gamer I didn't recommend this phone. It runs any game easily. Day to day activities was great.Bulid Quality:- 4 out of 5This segment most of the phones has a plastic bulid. This phone comes from glass bulid and front and back with coring gorilla glass 5 production.Software:- 2.5 out of 5Pros:The MIUI has a some cool features. It has many practical features like get and tax calculator, book taxi with out app support, MIUI calendar.Neutral:It doesn't have a app drawer. If you want app drawer poco launcher was better option with MIUI.Cons:This one is most disappointed thing in this phone. Everyone knows MIUI has ads, If you forget to disable the recommendations the annoying Ads appeared. This phone launched intially as MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie. Later it get only MIUI 11 Update only not a Android 10 update. Also the previous generation Redmi 7 and Redmi Note 7 get VoWifi update. But this mobile still not get this update.Display:-  4 out of 5Yes, It has Full HD+ IPS LCD Panel. But it looks good. It bright LCD display, Not level of Amoled display. It doesn't have HDR 10 Support.Audio:- 4 out of 5The speaker audio output was loud and clear. The audio output from 3.5mm audio jack also great. Overall best multimedia experience.Battery:- 5 out of 5I'll recommend this phone for this battery performance. This 4000 mAh battery with Full HD+ screen engough  for a day. But It stands more the one day with heavy usage. In my testing  every day at least have a 20% remaining while charging. Also Xiaomi provide 18W fast charger out of the box. This can charge 0 to 100% within 1 and half hours.Ram Management:- 4 out of 5I used 6 GB ram varient this ram management was okay. Open files are quickly.Security:- 4 out of 5The rear mount fingerprint sensor fast and secure. The front camera also support software face lock it also fast.Other:- 4 out of 5Signal reception and call quality great.

Xiaomi,"average phone. after using two weeks i just analyse that it is a average phone in this price catagory. price should not be more than 10,000/- for this phone.
here i analyse some pros and cons of this phone after countinious using of this phone.
PROS:-
1.screen resolution is preety good 1080 x 2280 pixels, colours contrast also very impressive.
2.two days battery backup if you not playing heavy games on it like PUBG.
3.Snapdragon 625 is old but till now it's performance is awsm ,you did not face any lag in games in low graphic setting.
4.camera pictures quality is good, also portrait mode captures the good depth effect in photos but only in Day light condition in night you will face high noice in pictures
5.front facing camera also have AI depth effect it not too much good but you can take good selfy in day light condition.
6.process optimization in this phone is good.
7.there are a little notch which increase the looks and design of phone.
CONS:-
1.one thing i hate in this phone is its notifaction bar, you will not get all notification on top bar, every time you need to scroll down the ntification bar to see app notifications. net speed meter is also not shown and no whatsapp icon notification on the top of the bar. because of the notch on the screen. Mi company should needs to fix these minaor issues by new updatess.
2.Downloading process in background is little bit slow in this phone as compare to other redmi phones.
3. video recording quality of this phone is not good.
